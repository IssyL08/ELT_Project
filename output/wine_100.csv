100,Chambers Rosewood Vineyards NV Rare Muscat (Rutherglen),"This wine contains some material over 100 years old, but shows no signs of fragility. Instead, it's concentrated through age and should hold in the bottle indefinitely. It's dark coffee-brown in color, with delectable aromas of rancio, dried fig, molasses and black tea, yet despite enormous concentration avoids excessive weight. And it's amazingly complex and fresh on the nearly endless finish.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz,350.0,Rare,Muscat,Rutherglen,,Victoria,Australia,Chambers Rosewood Vineyards,
100,Avignonesi 1995 Occhio di Pernice  (Vin Santo di Montepulciano),"Thick as molasses and dark as caramelized brown sugar, the wine oozes out of the bottle releasing concentrated aromas of butterscotch, toffee, honey, licorice, coffee, resin and maple syrup. Grapes from the Montepulciano area are dried in a ventilated room and the wine ages over 10 years in tiny oak barrels resulting in thick, dark concentration. Don't pair it with food: Vin Santo as good as this deserves to be enjoyed alone, as a so-called “meditation wine.”",,,210.0,Occhio di Pernice,Prugnolo Gentile,Vin Santo di Montepulciano,,Tuscany,Italy,Avignonesi,
100,Krug 2002 Brut  (Champagne),"This is a fabulous wine from the greatest Champagne vintage so far this century. Still young, it blends almost equal amounts of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay fleshed out with Pinot Meunier. The minerality and the rich apple and green fruits are balanced, and acidity cuts into the wine with a pure, perfumed line of freshness. The wine could be drunk now, but it will age well into the the 2020s.",Roger Voss,@vossroger,259.0,Brut,Champagne Blend,Champagne,,Champagne,France,Krug,
100,Tenuta dell'Ornellaia 2007 Masseto Merlot (Toscana),"A perfect wine from a classic vintage, the 2007 Masseto (100% Merlot from a 17-acre vineyard of the same name) opens with an unabashedly opulent bouquet of delicious blackberry, cherry, chocolate, vanilla, exotic spice and cinnamon. Masseto excels both in terms of quality of fruit and winemaking and delivers plush, velvety tannins and an extra long, supple finish. It will make a special and valuable collection to your cellar.",,,460.0,Masseto,Merlot,Toscana,,Tuscany,Italy,Tenuta dell'Ornellaia,
100,Casa Ferreirinha 2008 Barca-Velha Red (Douro),This is the latest release of what has long been regarded as Portugal's iconic wine. And it is magnificent. The last vintage was the 2004 and the wait has now shown to be worthwhile. With its immense span and breadth of flavors and rich structure it is a superb manifestation of the great vineyards of the Douro Superior. Big bold fruits and acidity are matched by the tannins and concentration. Hold this for many years or at least wait until 2022.,Roger Voss,@vossroger,450.0,Barca-Velha,Portuguese Red,,,Douro,Portugal,Casa Ferreirinha,
100,Biondi Santi 2010 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino),"This gorgeous, fragrant wine opens with classic Sangiovese scents of violet, rose, perfumed red berry, new leather and a whiff of baking spice. The elegant, radiant palate delivers crushed Marasca cherry, ripe strawberry, cinnamon, black tea and a hint of pipe tobacco. Firm, ultrafine tannins and bright acidity offer an age-worthy structure and impeccable balance. It's already stunning but will evolve for decades. Drink 2020–2050.",Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe,550.0,Riserva,Sangiovese,Brunello di Montalcino,,Tuscany,Italy,Biondi Santi,
100,Cardinale 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Tasted in a flight of great and famous Napa wines, this Cardinale stood at the head of the pack. Starts with a very fine nose of cedar, cassis, ripe blackberries and violets, then turns dramatic and refined in the mouth. Shows vast depth and length, with the finish a full minute of sweet fruits and spices. Marvelous tannins, so plush and elegant, so powerful yet refined. The grapes hail from Mt. Veeder, Howell Mountain, Stags Leap and Oakville, and the blend contains 14% Merlot. As good as it is now, it will improve for at least eight years.",,,200.0,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Napa Valley,Napa,California,US,Cardinale,
100,Château Léoville Barton 2010  Saint-Julien,"This is a magnificently solid wine, initially even a bit severe. At this young stage, the tannins dominate, but it's also full of black fruit notes. Very dense and concentrated, this is a wine that's even better than the legendary 2005. The structure tells of its extraordinary aging potential: don't even attempt to drink this for 10 years.",Roger Voss,@vossroger,150.0,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Saint-Julien,,Bordeaux,France,Château Léoville Barton,
100,Louis Roederer 2008 Cristal Vintage Brut  (Champagne),"This latest incarnation of the famous brand is a superb wine. It is on par with, maybe even better than, the already legendary 2002. Its balance is impeccable: Apple and citrus flavors working with the tight minerality to give a textured yet fruity wine. Produced from Roederer's own vineyards which are mainly biodynamic, the wine has its own intense purity and crispness. It has amazing potential and is likely to age for many years. Drink from 2020.",Roger Voss,@vossroger,250.0,Cristal Vintage Brut,Champagne Blend,Champagne,,Champagne,France,Louis Roederer,
100,Salon 2006 Le Mesnil Blanc de Blancs Brut Chardonnay (Champagne),"This new release from a great vintage for Chardonnay in Champagne is a perfect blanc de blancs, showing a wealth of intensity from the crisp, chalky, mineral tones to the perfumed apple notes. The aromas hint at developing toastiness that adds depth and complexity. The wine is still young and it will age for years. Drink from 2020.",Roger Voss,@vossroger,617.0,Le Mesnil Blanc de Blancs Brut,Chardonnay,Champagne,,Champagne,France,Salon,
100,Château Lafite Rothschild 2010  Pauillac,"Almost black in color, this stunning wine is gorgeous, rich and dense. It's grand and powerful, with a strong sense of its own importance. The beautiful tannins and the fragrant black currant fruits are palpable. It's a great wine, with huge potential.",Roger Voss,@vossroger,1500.0,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Pauillac,,Bordeaux,France,Château Lafite Rothschild,
100,Casanova di Neri 2007 Cerretalto  (Brunello di Montalcino),"It takes only a few moments before you appreciate the enormity, intensity and overall beauty of this landmark wine. Cerretalto is always a high scoring expression of Brunello, but the ideal conditions of the 2007 vintage elevate it to earthly perfection. Dark and fleshy, the wine delivers ever-evolving aromas of dark fruit, chocolate, spice and tobacco. The acidity is carefully balanced against the wine's thickness and rich texture. The finish is long, luscious and elegant. Keep this bottle in your cellar 10 years or more.",,,270.0,Cerretalto,Sangiovese Grosso,Brunello di Montalcino,,Tuscany,Italy,Casanova di Neri,
100,Château Cheval Blanc 2010  Saint-Émilion,"This is the finest Cheval Blanc for many years. It is, quite simply, magnificent. The wine shows the greatness of Cabernet Franc in the vintage, with 57% of the variety in the blend. It is beautifully structured and perfumed, with velvety tannins, balanced acidity and swathes of black-currant and black-cherry fruits. It's well on course to becoming a legendary wine.",Roger Voss,@vossroger,1500.0,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Saint-Émilion,,Bordeaux,France,Château Cheval Blanc,
100,Château Léoville Las Cases 2010  Saint-Julien,"A hugely powerful wine, full of dark, brooding tannins. It's a wine for seriously long-term aging, a sculptural vision of classic Bordeaux structure with with classy, ripe blackberry fruits. It has fresh acidity and an immense full-bodied character, cut through with mineral acidity. A great wine, with great potential.",Roger Voss,@vossroger,359.0,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Saint-Julien,,Bordeaux,France,Château Léoville Las Cases,
100,Charles Smith 2006 Royal City Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"In 2005 Charles Smith introduced three high-end Syrahs. In 2006 Smith has made a wine better than each of these, by combining them into a single wine—Royal City Syrah. Rich scents of purple fruit, smoked meat, cedar, lead pencil, moist earth and so on proclaim a wine with genuine gravitas. There is nothing missing, from the first sniff to the last sip, the wine delivers on all levels. Complex, beautifully balanced, powerful and detailed.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,80.0,Royal City,Syrah,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Washington,US,Charles Smith,
100,Quinta do Noval 2011 Nacional Vintage  (Port),"A powerful and ripe wine, strongly influenced by its tannins, super ripe black fruit and great structure. It has all the hallmarks of a long-lived vintage Port—very rich, while densely textured and firm. This is an amazing, impressive, concentrated wine, with huge potential. From a parcel of ungrafted vines at Noval.",Roger Voss,@vossroger,650.0,Nacional Vintage,Port,,,Port,Portugal,Quinta do Noval,
100,Verité 2007 La Muse Red (Sonoma County),"This wine dazzles with perfection. Sourced from vineyards throughout Sonoma County, it refutes the belief that a great Cabernet must come from a single vineyard. It does not. The master's art of blending, coupled with demanding vineyard practices lends completeness. The blend is 85% Merlot, 10% Cabernet Franc and 5% Malbec, making it an extraordinary success despite the absence of Cabernet Sauvignon. Give credit to winemaker Pierre Seillan. The wine itself is absolutely dry. It starts with a tug of tannins, baring flavors of blackberries, black currants, minerals and new oak, with earthy, herbal and meaty complexities. This is a magnificent wine; it dazzles now and should evolve over the next 6–8 years.",,,450.0,La Muse,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Sonoma County,Sonoma,California,US,Verité,
100,Cayuse 2008 Bionic Frog Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Initially a rather subdued Frog; as if it has been tamed down. Then, suddenly, There's a plush core of blackberry fruit, and the classic Cayuse funkiness is there, drenched in liquid rocks and cured meat and drying tannins. It's all in proportion and a fine reflection of the steely vintage. As it opens gracefully you discover that it is a stunningly refined Frog, quite possibly the best ever; powerful and distinctive, but also elegant, feminine.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,80.0,Bionic Frog,Syrah,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Washington,US,Cayuse,
