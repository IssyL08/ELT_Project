Complex and inviting nose layered with a strong earthy minerality, vibrant bright fruit and intriguing notes of petrol and honey. On the palate it is racy, taut and focused full of well defined ripe succulent citrus and stone fruit. Rich, viscous texture perfectly balanced by the wine's crispness and almost steely minerality.

120,92,Ceretto 2003 Bricco Rocche Prapó  (Barolo),"Slightly backward, particularly given the vintage, the wine has a complex nose with plenty of dark fruit, Turkish delight, smoked meat and earth. A full rich palate, slightly soft, it begins to run out of steam a little in mid palate, but returns with a flourish, and the finish is long and nuanced. Will repay 5+ years of cellaring.",,,70.0,Bricco Rocche Prapó,Nebbiolo,Barolo,,Piedmont,Italy,Ceretto,,
121,92,Matrix 2007 Stuhlmuller Vineyard Chardonnay (Alexander Valley),"The vineyard is one of the better Chardonnay sources in Alexander Valley, and in this fine vintage it lends ripe pineapple, pear, Key lime pie and Mandarin orange flavors to the wine.

There are few red wines in the world like this. It's fully dry, with potent flavors of baked blackberries, blackcurrants, cola and peppery spices, and the tannins are huge, but negotiable.

Words like opulent and elegant come to mind to describe intense flavors of black cherries, licorice, cola, herb tea and Indian spices. It's bone dry, and also quite tannic, but you can enjoy it now with big, rich lamb and beef dishes, or a wild mushroom risotto.

284,92,Viña Cobos 2011 Marchiori Vineyard Block C2 Malbec (Perdriel),"This huge Malbec defines jammy and concentrated. The bouquet is ripe, soft and minty, while the palate echoes the nose with thickness and density.

293,92,Kilikanoon 2009 Green's Vineyard Shiraz (Barossa Valley),"This wine displays ample concentration in its inky color and potent aromas of dark berry fruit. There's a hint of raisining as well. In the mouth, it's mouthfilling but lacks a bit of texture; the flavors include dark plums, vanilla and hints of dried fruits, like figs and dates.

455,92,Robert Mondavi 2011 Reserve Chardonnay (Carneros),"Fine acidity and a bracing minerality, like a lick of cold steel on a winter day, mark this Chardonnay.

There is a hint of gun metal running through the palate, and as the wine warms and slowly opens, it reveals a lingering finish with a little pat of butter left on the tongue. This should be in fine shape for at least another decade.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,65.0,Evenstad Reserve,Pinot Noir,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Oregon,US,Domaine Serene,,

475,92,Bell 2009 Clone 6 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon was grown in the well-known Beckstoffer Georges III Vineyard. It's at a funny stage of development, with primary cherry and blackberry fruit starting to fade, while sage, dill, green olive and dried fruit notes are emerging.

631,92,Willm 2011 Vendanges Tardives Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"Lifted notes of honey and rose petal play on the nose, the palate is altogether more lively than the nose suggests: sprightly and fresh, concentrated and caramel-tinged with lemon freshness.

636,92,Torbreck 2010 The Factor Shiraz (Barossa Valley),"The Torbreck wines, with the emphasis they place on ripeness, can sometimes be controversial. This one is full bodied and rich, with dense plum and chocolate notes that verge on being fudge-like. But those elements are lifted slightly by hints of mint and bacon.

637,92,Biecher & Schaal 2014 Altenberg de Bergheim Grand Cru White (Alsace),"A rather perfumed nose hints at the Gewurztraminer that colors this Riesling with rose petal and honeysuckle notes. The co-planted varieties in this vineyard make a smashing duo since they are almost polar opposites: structured, straight-laced Riesling with its fine spine of acidity benefits from the playfulness and charm of aromatic, fleshy Gewurztraminer which in turn is lit up by Riesling's freshness. Really, this is a case where you can have the best of both worlds.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino,45.0,Altenberg de Bergheim Grand Cru,Alsace white blend,Alsace,,Alsace,France,Biecher & Schaal,,

5126,92,Gunter Triebaumer 2014 Gillesberg Cabernet Franc (Burgenland),"The nose is tightly closed, yet there is the suspicion of fine fruit. The grippy palate brims with peppery dark-plum fruit and very fine distinct tannins that give this a taut, rigid frame that still needs to relax. This is unusual in so far that it is a Cabernet Franc from Austria, grown on slate. It works well: The tannic structure and fruit are fully expressed.

5130,92,Château des Jacques 2015 Côte du Py  (Morgon),"Owned by Beaune merchant Louis Jadot, this cru estate produces some impressive wines. While its alcohol is excessive for a Beaujolais, it wears its power well.

There's loads of upfront Asian spice and lychee, afloat on a luxurious, sensually textured palate.

7793,92,Alzinger 2013 Steinertal Smaragd Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),"This is still closed tightly and barely wants to give away more than punchy grapefruit zest, but the balanced palate that cushions the fresh but ripe acidity suggests that this will open up gradually.

Everything is in proportion, with a most pleasing finish.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,28.0,Lark,Chardonnay,Dundee Hills,Willamette Valley,Oregon,US,Durant,,
8391,92,Écluse 2013 Rendition Red (Paso Robles),"Inky dark in the glass, this blend of 48% Syrah, 39% Grenache and 13% Mourvèdre offers up dense and potent blackberry and blueberry fruit aromas, enhanced by black pepper and bacon-fat richness. Blackberry fruit starts the sip and then it deepens into earth, tobacco and smoke. It's a fine study of darkness.",Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann,38.0,Rendition,Rhône-style Red Blend,Paso Robles,Central Coast,California,US,Écluse,,
8392,92,Elias Mora 2012 Crianza  (Toro),"Toasty, warm, lusty dark-berry aromas are laced with a subtle animal accent. This is a big wine, with a fleshy, tannic, muscular feel. Flavors of blackberry, mocha and chocolate finish in fine form, with moderate tannic grip and all sorts of length. Drink this excellent Toro through 2022.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach,40.0,Crianza,Tinta de Toro,Toro,,Northern Spain,Spain,Elias Mora,,
8393,92,Elizabeth Chambers 2014 Winemaker's Cuvée Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Tasted alongside the 2013, this is bigger, bolder, fruitier and more powerful, yet a touch less refined. The strawberry and cherry fruit is underscored with a pleasing minerality. The tannins are substantial and in proportion. A hint of chicken stock runs through the finish.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,35.0,Winemaker's Cuvée,Pinot Noir,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Oregon,US,Elizabeth Chambers,,
8394,92,Errazuriz 2013 Don Maximiano Founder's Reserve Red (Aconcagua Valley),"Earthy black-olive and foresty herbal scents accent core blackberry and moss aromas.

8395,92,Vega Sicilia 2007 Unico  (Ribera del Duero),"Aromas of raisin and cassis lean in the direction of overripe. This is less elegant and more blocky than most bottlings of Unico, but with ripe, loamy blackberry and plum flavors, it tastes great. A slightly hollow but round finish with mild residual tannins suggests that this be drunk now through 2024.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach,450.0,Unico,Red Blend,Ribera del Duero,,Northern Spain,Spain,Vega Sicilia,,
8396,92,Waxwing 2014 Lester Family Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Cherry tomatoes, black olives, Kalamata olives, green olives, black pepper and dried herbs show on the nose of this zesty wine, done in a lavish not sparse manner. A rainbow of peppercorns pop on the palate, touching on the grape's herbaceous tendencies and showing tagine and tapenade flavors, but with tons of vibrancy and freshness. A well-done version of this flavor profile.",Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann,45.0,Lester Family Vineyard,Pinot Noir,Santa Cruz Mountains,Central Coast,California,US,Waxwing,,
8397,92,Pagter Brothers 2013 Pinot Noir (Paso Robles Willow Creek District),"Made by brothers Scott and Gib Pagter, this rich wine is scented with sandalwood, strawberry, incense and chaparral shrub.

8398,92,Peter Jakob Kühn 2014 Jacobus Trocken Riesling (Rheingau),"While low in alcohol and austere in dryness, there's a remarkable richness of texture that lends an impression of volume and density on the palate. Brisk notes of lemon and tart tangerine shine brightly, but are juxtaposed by an intensely stony, mineral finish. Drink now through 2020.",Anna Lee C. Iijima,,22.0,Jacobus Trocken,Riesling,,,Rheingau,Germany,Peter Jakob Kühn,,
8399,92,Rex Hill 2013 Alpine Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Sourced from vines almost 40-years-old, this is tight and spicy, with a potpourri of herbs from mint to tarragon to chive. The core of wild berry fruit is substantial. Don't miss the trailing finish.

8400,92,Riverbench 2014 Cork Jumper Brut Rosé Sparkling (Santa Maria Valley),"Hay yellow in color, with a wispy shade of pink in the core, this bubbly shows aromas of lemon chiffon, sourdough toast, white peach and a touch of quinine on the nose.

8401,92,Sanford 2013 Sanford & Benedict Vineyard Viognier (Sta. Rita Hills),"A clean and crisp style of Viognier, which comes in all forms these days, this bottling is light yet expressive on the nose with yellow grapefruit, lemon ice and a touch of chamomile tea. The palate is very grippy with crushed rocks, and also rich with buttered pear in the creamy, almost buttery midpalate, yet somehow remains lean and laser-focused.",Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann,36.0,Sanford & Benedict Vineyard,Viognier,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,California,US,Sanford,,
8402,92,Sodaro 2013 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Coombsville),"A 100% varietal wine aged in entirely new French oak, this is a big-bodied, grippy wine. It's slightly syrupy with ripe red fruit and a complexity of dried herb and cedar which makes it a fine representative of the relatively cooler appellation from which it comes.",Virginie Boone,@vboone,150.0,Estate,Cabernet Sauvignon,Coombsville,Napa,California,US,Sodaro,,
8403,92,Tablas Creek 2013 Mourvèdre (Adelaida District),"Light black cherry, turned black loam and dried rose petals show on the nose of this straightforward and earthy bottling.

8404,92,Terre Rouge 2013 Monarch Mine Vineyard Syrah (Sierra Foothills),"Classic flavors, great structure and impressive depth make this wine tempting to drink now, but it will certainly improve with age. Hints of light nutmeg and coriander mingle with stronger blackberry and black pepper in the aromas and flavors. It has that slightly wild, gamey character of the Rhône, along with ripe but slightly restrained fruit and spices. Best from 2018 to 2023.",Jim Gordon,@gordone_cellars,40.0,Monarch Mine Vineyard,Syrah,Sierra Foothills,Sierra Foothills,California,US,Terre Rouge,,
8405,92,Covila 2010 Pagos de Labarca  (Rioja),"Covila produces mostly good-quality affordable Rioja wines, but with this bottling the winery has stepped it up a notch. Aromas of raisin, graphite, prune, vanilla and coconut are ripe and oaky. A chunky, blocky, ripe palate holds blackberry and cassis flavors that come with notes of dried herbs. Chewy tannins and peppery spice push a bold finish. Drink through 2022.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach,31.0,Pagos de Labarca,Tempranillo Blend,Rioja,,Northern Spain,Spain,Covila,,
8406,92,Halcon 2013 Alturas Syrah (Yorkville Highlands),"Whiffs of wood smoke, black pepper and clove bring an exotic touch to this dry, medium-bodied and tautly balanced wine. It stops just short of full ripeness, but has ample enough blackberry and black olive flavors to taste complete and to reverberate on the finish. It has great varietal character, and will be interesting to age through 2019.",Jim Gordon,@gordone_cellars,32.0,Alturas,Syrah,Yorkville Highlands,North Coast,California,US,Halcon,,
8407,92,Kirsten 2013 1904 Spätlese Riesling (Mosel),"Old vines dating back to 1904 produce this unusually brawny late-harvest wine. It's deeply fruity, almost tropical in profile, bursting with sun-kissed mango and guava flavors.

8437,92,Thomas Fogarty 2009 Albutom Vineyard Estate Grown Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Some will find this Chardonnay severe and lacking in richness as it's marked by dryness, minerality and acidity, rather than tropical fruit and sweet oak.It would not be surprising if this wine made gains in 5–6 years, but even if it doesn't, it defines a more elegant style.",,,50.0,Albutom Vineyard Estate Grown,Chardonnay,Santa Cruz Mountains,Central Coast,California,US,Thomas Fogarty,,
8438,92,Von Holt 2010 Bacigalupi Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"There's lots of mouthwatering acidity in this bone-dry Pinot Noir, with an ample supply of ripe fruit in the form of raspberries and cherries. There's also something wonderfully earthy, like roasted mushrooms splashed with balsamic and tamari sauce. The cool 2010 vintage was kind to Bacigalupi Vineyard, which can produce overripe wines in hot years.",,,39.0,Bacigalupi Vineyard,Pinot Noir,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,California,US,Von Holt,,
8439,92,Kunde 2009 Limited Selection Petite Verdot (Sonoma Valley),"A wonderful wine, one of the best Petite Verdots in California, although the truth is there aren't all that many.

8440,92,La Sirena 2009 Pirate TreasuRed Red (Napa Valley),"Whatever the blend is on this red wine, and winemaker Heidi Barrett isn't saying, it's really interesting. The bottle is old-fashioned and stubby, like something from the 1700s. The wine itself is immediately likeable for its spicy array of spices and berries. Despite its upfront appeal, there's a complexity that elevates it.",,,60.0,Pirate TreasuRed,Red Blend,Napa Valley,Napa,California,US,La Sirena,,

8442,92,Windstream 2010 Sarmento Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Insanely rich, this explodes in the mouth with orange, pineapple, apricot, tropical fruit and sweet new-oak flavors. The richness is tempered with crisp acidity and a minerality that tastes like a lick of cold steel.

8443,92,E. Guigal 2006  Hermitage,"This is the current release from Guigal, which makes it one of the few Hermitages on store shelves that's ready to drink. It's medium to full in weight, chunky and assertive, but not overly concentrated or tannic.

8444,92,a-non-ah-mus 2009 Alisos Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"This is made in a ripe, high-alcohol style, which gives it a little burning sensation, like Cognac.

8446,92,Trapiche 2008 Gran Medalla Malbec (Mendoza),"Smooth and polished, this bears cola, earth, blackberry and floral aromas. It shows power and precision, with silky tannins, integrated acidity and deep flavors of berry, leather and herb. This is slightly minty, smoky and spicy on the back end, where fine oak takes charge.

8447,92,Stephen Ross 2010 Bien Nacido Vineyards Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),"Delicious and crisp in acidity, this is dry despite its flavors of honey and ripe, jammy tropical fruit. How this wine achieves such a quality is magic, but the brisk acidity helps, as does its stony minerality. Ready to enjoy now.",,,32.0,Bien Nacido Vineyards,Chardonnay,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,California,US,Stephen Ross,,
8448,92,Caves Aliança 2007 Quinta das Baceladas Red (Bairrada),"Earthy aromas are a hallmark of the Baga grape, a component of this full-bodied, tannic blend.

8449,92,Cielo y Tierra 2007 Don Juan Nahuel Malbec (Mendoza),"This opens with persuasive aromas of wild berry and cassis before cola and leather notes enter. It's a powerfully built Malbec with bright acidity, strong bones and pure, bold flavors of blackberry and black cherry.

8450,92,Davis Family 2009 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A consummate Russian River Pinot Noir in an accessible style.

8451,92,Freeman 2010 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"A beautiful Pinot to drink now, this is elegant and supple, with crisp acidity and a delightfully light texture.

8452,92,Clos Gebrat 2010 Red (Priorat),"Fresh, floral and not overbearing on the nose, this has red berry and cassis aromas, with no interference from oak or too much extraction.

Good for near-term drinking.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach,24.0,,Red Blend,Priorat,,Catalonia,Spain,Clos Gebrat,,
8453,92,Ochoa 2010 Vino Dulce Moscatel (Navarra),"This smells like orange marmalade.

8454,92,Paul Jaboulet Aîné 2009 Domaine de Thalabert  (Crozes-Hermitage),"Despite this wine's thick veneer of toasty, vanilla-scented oak, it has plenty of underlying fruit, powerful enough to handle the wood. It's full bodied, dense and richly textured, with a long, velvety finish redolent of blackberries and cedar.

8455,92,Petra 2008 Petra Red (Toscana),"From one of Italy's most important showcase designer wineries, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot lives up to its super Tuscan celebrity. It is gently redolent of dark chocolate, ripe fruit, leather, tobacco and crushed black pepper—the bouquet's elegant moderation is one of its strongest points. The mouthfeel is rich, creamy and long.

8458,92,Lungarotti 2007 Rubesco Riserva Vigna Monticchio Red (Torgiano),"This wine's most outstanding quality is the elegant and delicate manner with which the bouquet slowly reveals itself.

8459,92,Migration 2010 Charles Heintz Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),"Showing the richness of the vineyard, this delivers huge, flamboyant flavors of apricot and tangerine jam. While it's technically dry, there's a honeyed sweetness that suggests a touch of botrytis. It's a strong wine, unafraid to command a boldness that may not be for everyone. This is distinctly Californian in style, and as it loses fruit with age, it will develop nut and earthy notes.",,,55.0,Charles Heintz Vineyard,Chardonnay,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,California,US,Migration,,
8460,92,Pessagno 2010 Sleepy Hollow Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Rich doesn't begin to describe the layers of flavor and texture. This wine is massive, with notes of tropical fruit and apricot, with a slightly botrytized character that Sleepy Hollow Chardonnays often display. The oak is lavish and buttery, but perfectly matched to the wine's volume. It also has classic Monterey acidity—as pert as a squeeze of lime.

8463,92,Thomas Fogarty 2009 Langley Hill Vineyard Estate Grown Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Fogarty continues its streak of great, Chablis-style Chardonnays with this single-vineyard bottling. True afficionados will love the dryness, acidity and minerality, which give it such great structure. The severity is relieved by flavors of citrus zest and white peach, and the creamy sourdough richness imparted by lees aging. Try aging it for at least six years.",,,50.0,Langley Hill Vineyard Estate Grown,Chardonnay,Santa Cruz Mountains,Central Coast,California,US,Thomas Fogarty,,
8464,92,Maison Nicolas Perrin 2009  Crozes-Hermitage,"This full-bodied, creamy Crozes-Hermitage far outpaces expectations for the appellation, combining cherry-berry fruit with cracked pepper, mocha and licorice.

8910,92,Pessagno 2006 Sleepy Hollow Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Pessagno has a perfect track record with this cool-climate vineyard, consisently producing Chards of this caliber. The wine is tight in acids and flinty minerals, even showing new oaky tannins. But the exotic nuances of roasted peaches and grilled pineapples suggest cellarability.

8913,92,Domaine Philippe Delesvaux 2005 Sélection de Grains Nobles Chenin Blanc (Coteaux du Layon),"You can tell this is going to be sweet by its gold color. And there's no deception, except along with that sweetness there is a surprising (and delightful) freshness, which comes from sweet apple juice acidity. The toffee is more obvious than the honey, but this remains a fresh, vivid wine.",Roger Voss,@vossroger,,Sélection de Grains Nobles,Chenin Blanc,Coteaux du Layon,,Loire Valley,France,Domaine Philippe Delesvaux,,
8914,92,Dutton-Goldfield 2006 Morelli Lane Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"Winemaker Steve Goldfield brings the same deft touch he displays with Pinot Noir to this lush, elegant wine.

8918,92,Felsina 2004 Riserva Rancia  (Chianti Classico),"Compared to Felsina's other Riserva from the same vintage, Rancia offers more evident use of oak and is shaped by natural aromas of bright berry and supple notes of vanilla and spice.

9449,92,Hiedler 2015 Spiegel Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),"Yeasty, miso-like savor dominates the fresh aroma, however, the palate adds wonderfully zesty lime notes and a rounder, more sonorous and richer component of yellow pear.

9450,92,Lecco 2011 Reserva  (Ribera del Duero),"Minty, oaky, smoky aromas of ripe blackberry draw you towards a saturated, full-bodied palate with hard tannins.

It's dry, full bodied and pretty massive in terms of mouthfeel, so this is not a delicate flower and is best enjoyed with heartier fare or after some time to open.",Jim Gordon,@gordone_cellars,66.0,Stormin',Pinot Noir,Anderson Valley,,California,US,Maggy Hawk,,

9458,92,Türk 2015 Kremser Weinberge Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal),"Everything is still tightly coiled: the intense Conference pear fruit, the zesty lime notes, the deeply herbal savoriness.

9514,92,The Withers Winery 2013 Mr. Burgess Red (El Dorado),"Imposing, concentrated and tannic, this Syrah-based blend needs time to mature and soften. It has vivid aromas and flavors of black pepper, clove, cranberry and dark chocolate plus an almost rigid mouthfeel from a thick underpinning of fine tannins.

9518,92,Reinhold Haart 2014 Wintricher Ohligsberger Grosse Lage Spätlese Riesling (Mosel),"Joyously ripe, this lip-smackingly fruity wine sings of a summer's bounty of peach, apricot and orange flavors.

9522,92,Spangler 2015 Viognier (Southern Oregon),"This bright and spicy wine is packed with botanical flavors. The aromatics are pungent and intense, pushing sharp notes of lime, Meyer lemon and orange soda deep into the palate. In some ways this has the penetrating density of Gewürztraminer.

9523,92,Tahbilk 2009 Museum Release Marsanne (Nagambie Lakes),"Tasted at their regular release date less than a year after the vintage, the Tahbilk Marsannes aren't terribly expressive. The key is bottle age, and this Museum Release has it. Lemon custard and thyme are tinged with hints of toast and marmalade in this medium-bodied white. A touch of creaminess on the midpalate extends through a long finish.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz,23.0,Museum Release,Marsanne,Nagambie Lakes,,Victoria,Australia,Tahbilk,,
9524,92,Terre Rouge 2013 Mourvèdre (Sierra Foothills),"Ah, this wine is distinctive and practically haunting in personality, as wild, earthy, sage and mushroom aromas meet meaty, savory, mineral-like flavors on a well-balanced frame of good acidity and appetizing, fine-grained tannins.",Jim Gordon,@gordone_cellars,30.0,,Mourvèdre,Sierra Foothills,Sierra Foothills,California,US,Terre Rouge,,

9531,92,Domaine Marcel Deiss 2009 Burlenberg Red (Alsace),"There is an appealing rusticity and a certain wildness about this wine. Hints of smoke and singed meat makes it visceral and unusual. Red fruit lurks here and there between the earthier notes and there also is a grip of firm, but unforced tannin.

9768,92,Adastra 2004 Merlot (Carneros),"An interesting, off-beat Merlot that successfully marches to a different drummer. There's a leathery, meaty quality to the blackberry and cherry fruit flavors that probably comes from the Syrah in the blend. It's also bone dry and fairly rigid in tannins.

9773,92,Bouchard Aîné & Fils 2005  Clos de la Roche,"Wines from Morey-Saint-Denis should be opulent in 2005, and this wine has opulence in spades. It fills the mouth with rich red plums, red cherries and some cranberry juice to give an edge of dryness.

9777,92,Kurt Hain 2006 Piesporter Goldtröpfchen Spätlese Riesling (Mosel-Saar-Ruwer),"Rich, viscous and sweet, this is a spätlese that punches above its weight. A bit of dried apricot hints at the inclusion of some botrytized grapes, while the rest of the fruit shows superripe flavors of peaches and honey. This is long on the finish, clinging to the palate.

9778,92,Flechas de los Andes 2006 Gran Malbec (Uco Valley),"Big-format Malbec is what we're calling this new 15.5% wine from Benjamin de Rothschild and Laurent Dassault, original partners in Michel Rolland's Clos de los Siete project. Round, lush and full of body, Flechas shows muscle but little fat. It's colorful, dark, full of black fruit and long on the finish. It is modern Malbec done for modern palates.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach,22.0,Gran,Malbec,Uco Valley,,Mendoza Province,Argentina,Flechas de los Andes,,
9779,92,Bodega Catena Zapata 2005 Catena Alta Chardonnay (Mendoza),"Since we last tried this wine, Catena has dialed back the new oak and pumped up the natural acidity. And the result is pleasantly akin to fine Burgundy. Now the emphasis is on refined, Dijon-style apple and peach flavors with great mouthfeel. Drink now.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach,35.0,Catena Alta,Chardonnay,Mendoza,,Mendoza Province,Argentina,Bodega Catena Zapata,,
9780,92,Bouchard Père & Fils 2005 Beaune du Château Premier Cru  (Beaune),"This ripe, almond- and pear-flavored wine has a fine balancing structure of green fruit skins. It's certainly rich, but it also has elegance, restraining its exuberance through the finishing acidity, which promises 5–7 years' aging.",Roger Voss,@vossroger,42.0,Beaune du Château Premier Cru,Chardonnay,Beaune,,Burgundy,France,Bouchard Père & Fils,,
9781,92,Bouchard Père & Fils 2005 Les Lavières Premier Cru  (Savigny-lès-Beaune),"For a Savigny, this is surprisingly firm and tannic, the wine's structure an impressive edifice of dry tannins and firm cranberry and plum skin flavors. It is certainly ripe, the fruit promising attractive richness in 3–5 years, followed by good aging potential.",Roger Voss,@vossroger,43.0,Les Lavières Premier Cru,Pinot Noir,Savigny-lès-Beaune,,Burgundy,France,Bouchard Père & Fils,,
9782,92,Domaine de la Vougeraie 2005 Les Cras Premier Cru  (Vougeot),"Intensely perfumed, this wine shows both strength and great elegance. The raspberry flavors float over a light structure of some dry tannins. The acidity is there, but it is the generosity of the fruit that is most obvious, going right through the wine to the sweet, jammy finish.",Roger Voss,@vossroger,94.0,Les Cras Premier Cru,Pinot Noir,Vougeot,,Burgundy,France,Domaine de la Vougeraie,,
9783,92,Dr. H. Thanisch (Erben Müller-Burggraef) 2006 Bernkasteler Graben Spätlese Riesling (Mosel-Saar-Ruwer),"This is a rather big and burly wine for a Mosel spätlese, weighing in at 11.5% alcohol. And while it shows plenty of power, it also shows nuance in its aromas and flavors, which range from baked fruit, honey and spiced marmalade to oily, mineral essences. Has the concentration to age, but the balance of sugar and alcohol may not hold in the long run—drink it over the next few years to avoid disappointment.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz,29.0,Bernkasteler Graben Spätlese,Riesling,,,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer,Germany,Dr. H.

Somers Ranch is in the eastern hills, where it gets the full benefit of the afternoon sun.

9785,92,JLC 2004 Spofford Station Estate Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Though not as powerful and concentrated as the Spofford Station Syrah, this wine displays the same distinctive, complex flavor palette—a mix of earth, herb, compost, fungus, smoke, rock and, oh yeah, baby, oodles of fruit. This sort of flavor profile is similar to the biodynamic wines of Cayuse, but at half the cost.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,36.0,Spofford Station Estate,Merlot,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Washington,US,JLC,,
9786,92,Owen Roe 2006 Rosa Mystica Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Soft and seductive, this coffee-laced Cab Franc perfectly captures the dark aromas and crisply defined fruit of the grape. There's just a splash of DuBrul Merlot in the blend to add some buoyancy; but the Franc dominates. It's a cool-climate style, firm and tart, with natural acids and a lovely coffee and smoke streak running through polished tannins. Brilliant winemaking.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,42.0,Rosa Mystica,Cabernet Franc,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Washington,US,Owen Roe,,
9787,92,Woodward Canyon 2005 Artist Series #14 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This is taut and dense, and requires time and air to untangle. Deep, dark fruits are mixed in with layers of black olive, smoke, compost, tar, moist earth and herb—a delicious mélange of flavors that promises good things to come as the wine ages.

9788,92,Forgeron 2003 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The grapes come from three very widely separated vineyard sources. The Klipsun, says winemaker Marie-Eve Gilla, is for the backbone and tannins; the Pepper Bridge gives dried herbs and tighter tannins; and the Alder Ridge is more European and fills out the midpalate. This is showing very well, and has clearly benefited from the extra bottle age. It's beautifully integrated, with the tannins substantial but polished. The fruit mixes ripe berries and moves smoothly into flavors of earth, smoke, tobacco and graphite.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,30.0,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Washington,US,Forgeron,,
9789,92,Gunter Triebaumer 2005 Ruster Ausbruch Welschriesling (Burgenland),"The Rust style of ultra-sweet wine is all about wonderful honey and toffee flavors over intense acidity, a great balancing act of spice, dry botrytis and great sweetness. This wine is both fresh and complex, a bottle that needs at least 5 years to age. Screwcap.",Roger Voss,@vossroger,37.0,Ruster Ausbruch,Welschriesling,,,Burgenland,Austria,Gunter Triebaumer,,
9790,92,Achaval-Ferrer 2006 Finca Altamira Malbec (La Consulta),"One of the most untouched, terroir-driven Malbecs made in Argentina is Achaval-Ferrer's Altamira. It's harvested about three weeks earlier than most high-end fruit, resulting in core raspberry flavors and a certain redness of character. The wine is unfined and cloudy but still very clear on the palate, with length, power and class. Best from 2009–2012.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach,112.0,Finca Altamira,Malbec,La Consulta,,Mendoza Province,Argentina,Achaval-Ferrer,,
9791,92,Hirsch 2004 Gaisberg Riesling Riesling (Kamptal),"A wine that is on the cusp of adding an extra element of complexity. At present, there is deliciously perfumed fruit, white and green currants and white peaches, with a definite citrus edge. The bonus is the taut texture, which is closing in and lifting the fruit, promising future aging. Screwcap.",Roger Voss,@vossroger,46.0,Gaisberg Riesling,Riesling,,,Kamptal,Austria,Hirsch,,

10714,92,Beckmen 2011 Block Six Purisima Mountain Vineyard Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley),"Coming from the highest corner of the limestone-laden vineyard at 1,275 feet—with views of the entire Santa Ynez Valley—this gives off broad, approachable aromas of lit match, bacon fat, purple fruits, pepper and smoked meats.

10715,92,Black Hills 2012 Nota Bene Red (Okanagan Valley),"This is the winery's superstar Bordeaux-style blend, and one of the defining red wines of the Okanagan. In its youth it is peppery, tannic and tough, with strong herbal flavors, along with pomegranate, cranberry and white raspberry fruit.

10718,92,Hillinger 2012 Blaufränkisch (Leithaberg),"Still-subdued fruit signals that this needs time. The palate is tight and elegant, but riches of tart cherry fruit rest just beneath the surface and wait to emerge fully. There is acidic verve and velvety structure; nothing is overdone and it's very balanced. This fresh little number needs time to blossom.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino,39.0,,Blaufränkisch,,,Leithaberg,Austria,Hillinger,,
10719,92,Hillinger 2012 Hill 1 Red (Burgenland),"Spicy white pepper pervades this rich, rounded red. Structured tannins call for meat if this is to be drunk now.

10720,92,Lagler 2013 Spitzer 1000-Eimerberg Smaragd Neuburger (Wachau),"Breezy, zesty stoniness is overlaid with lemon freshness, suggesting a slender wine. However, the palate is rounded and generous, with layers of red apple, Comice pear, honeydew melon and orange zest.

10722,92,Margerum 2012 Über Syrah (Santa Barbara County),"This annually anticipated bottling offers a blend of Doug Margerum's top barrels from a variety of vineyards. In this vintage, aromas of baking spice and red fruit come with minty sagebrush lift.

10724,92,Muhr-Van der Niepoort 2012 Samt & Seide Blaufränkisch (Carnuntum),"This is as tightly closed as a new rosebud, but suspicions of iron oxide and red cherry escape. On the palate this has a northerly, cool aspect and its very own, reticent charm. More iron oxide comes to the fore, along with earthiness and a mix of elderberry and red cherry. If you have the patience to wait until 2017–2018, this will come to you as a grown-up beauty.

10725,92,Nigl 2013 Hochäcker Reserve Riesling (Kremstal),A beautifully subtle scent of Williams pear makes for a soft opening.

11092,92,Jacob's Creek 1998 Limited Release Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon (South Australia),"Jacob's Creek's top-end red is complex, dense and supple.

11093,92,Stonegate 1997 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Somehow, this fine winery gets left off a lot of “best of” lists, which makes it a great value, especially from a super vintage like ‘97. This is serious Napa Cabernet, filled with fancy black currant, cassis and mocha, and complex with toasty oak. It's very dry and elegant, one of those wines that fills the palate with the most sumptuous flavors and textures. It's so focused, it's delicious now, but there's no doubt it will age and improve for a long time.",,,25.0,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Napa Valley,Napa,California,US,Stonegate,,

11096,92,Kenwood 1997 Massara Vineyard Merlot (Sonoma Valley),"Dark, oaky, and fine in every respect. Sonoma Valley, often underrated as Merlot country, lends the fruit a very deep and satisfying blackberry component, which is highlighted, in this case, by toasty oak. The tannins are soft and finely etched. Gorgeous stuff, quite lovely now, but the solid core of fruit indicates mid-term aging potential.",,,25.0,Massara Vineyard,Merlot,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,California,US,Kenwood,,
11097,92,Seña 1997 Red (Aconcagua Valley),"From Robert Mondavi and Eduardo Chadwick, a Chilean producer (Errázuriz), this wine is a blend of 84% Cabernet Sauvignon and 16% Carmenère. The color is inky dark, and it smells young and intense, almost fiery—there's a suggestion of charcoal and embers. Massive fruit explodes in the mouth, but it's not a fruit bomb; it's much too sophisticated for that. Oak is fancy but not pronounced. Its aging timeline should be similar to that of a great Bordeaux.",,,60.0,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,,,Aconcagua Valley,Chile,Seña,,

11489,92,Écluse 2009 Reserve Lock Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"The trick to getting a Cabernet Sauvignon this ripe and oaky is to provide balance, and in this, Écluse has succeeded. Made from 100% Cabernet, it's enormously rich in blackberries and black currants, with dark chocolate, licorice and spice adding complexity. The tannins are, in a word, gorgeous. With high alcohol, the mouthfeel has a Cognac-like warmth, but doesn't feel uncomfortably hot.

11490,92,Finca Tobella 2006 Selecció Especial Red (Priorat),"There are many things to love about this blend of Carignan, Garnacha and Cabernet Sauvignon. To begin with, it's properly schisty and spicy on the nose, with mature, slightly herbal berry-fruit scents. This feels dynamic despite showing roasted flavors of red berry, pepper and wild herbs. For under $50, this delivers a lot of quality. Drink now–2016.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach,46.0,Selecció Especial,Red Blend,Priorat,,Catalonia,Spain,Finca Tobella,,
11491,92,Fournier Père et Fils 2008 Grand Fumé  (Pouilly-Fumé),"Now mature, this rounded, ripe wine has yellow fruits, mango and a soft, opulent texture.

11492,92,Bennett Lane 2009 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Right out of the bottle, this is one tough Cabernet. It's very tannic and extracted with blackberry jam, and the oak stands off to one side—sweet and smoky and flashy. However, that “Wow!” factor is always there, and the overall balance suggests cellaring. Already throwing some thick sediment, it should begin to mellow after 2018.",,,95.0,Reserve,Cabernet Sauvignon,Napa Valley,Napa,California,US,Bennett Lane,,
11493,92,Bjornstad 2009 Van der Kamp Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Mountain),"So delicious to drink now, it's easy to overlook the complexity and ageworthiness of this Pinot.

11495,92,Donum 2010 Estate Grown Chardonnay (Carneros),"So many things make this Chardonnay worthwhile. It's bone dry, low in alcohol, vibrant in acidity and minerally, which all give it a compelling delicacy and interest. Yet it's also intense and sweet in Meyer lemon fruit, with a touch of orange peel. If there's a criticism, it's that the oak is obvious, but that's a minor criticism.",,,50.0,Estate Grown,Chardonnay,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,California,US,Donum,,

It's from the Santa Ynez Valley, although you'd never know that from the label, and shows that region's affinity for producing superior Syrah, when the farming is good.

The '07, from a supercool vintage, is a little off the rich pace of the '06, but shows the same admirable qualities of dryness, racy acidity and complex flavor.

Because it's not like a Napa, Washington or Chilean Cabernet that oozes cassis, plum and sweet French oak.

18667,92,Eric Ross 2008 Saralee's Vineyard Marsanne-Roussanne (Russian River Valley),"A beautiful wine, dry, complex and crisp, and easily one of the best white Rhône-style bottlings of the vintage. It shows brilliantly clean acidity that provides a brisk mouthfeel to the apricot, pineapple and pear flavors that rest on a firm ground of minerals.

18674,92,Chanin 2007 Le Bon Climat Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Marked by aggressive acidity and some dusty tannins, this Pinot is not showing well now. It's just too hard and tart. But the flavors are enormously ripe, and the finish is dry and silky and long. It all suggests cellaring to let the cherries, black raspberries and Dr. Pepper cola emerge from their tomb. Better after 2011.",,,45.0,Le Bon Climat Vineyard,Pinot Noir,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,California,US,Chanin,,

21890,92,Dominio de Atauta 2008  Ribera del Duero,"Even in marginal vintages like 2008, Atauta manages to shine above the rest.

It's ripe and full in blackberries and currants, with a thick coating of sweet, toasty oak, but it's not really drinkable now because the tannins are so strong.

22279,92,Wild Hogge 2010 Moongate Red (Paso Robles),"It's too bad that this blend of 75% Zinfandel, 12% Cabernet Franc and 13% Syrah is only found in Bermuda.

Juxtaposing heady notes of bramble and dried herb against a backdrop of luscious black currant and plum, this wild-fermented red is enticingly “savage” in style.

Floods the mouth with cherry-berry flavors, yet somehow feels light and elegant despite the weight and tannins, which is a kind of magic. You'll find all kinds of raspberries, cherries, sandalwood and exotic spices, but the wine isn't really ready.

It's opulent even by California standards, and is a little sweet. With firm, pronounced tannins, it's gritty in texture. Defines Napa ripeness, but at this point it's rude and jammy.

It's rich and showy with plums and cherries, spicy notes of tobacco and pine, and toasty, new oak. The tannin-acid structure is impeccably balanced.

31351,92,Bailly-Lapierre 2005 Egarade Brut  (Crémant de Bourgogne),"Egarade means a “mysterious evening stroll,” according to the producer.

31356,92,Earthquake 2008 Petite Sirah (Lodi),"Not for everyone, this is the kind of Petite Sirah Quentin Tarantino would make if he made wine—big, in your face and ultimately a fine, bold wine full of intense black olive tapenade, chocolate and tobacco, with a tannic, peppery finish, a nod to its 22 months spent in French oak.

31358,92,Hanzell 2008 Sebella Chardonnay (Sonoma Valley),"Hanzell says this Sebella Chardonnay is meant to drink now, while their regular Chardonnay, which is famously ageable, develops in the cellar. That's strange logic, because the wine is so close to the regular Chardonnay as to be nearly indistinguishable. It's bone dry, crisply acidic and minerally, with citrus, green apple and pear flavors. Give it 3–5 years.",,,36.0,Sebella,Chardonnay,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,California,US,Hanzell,,

31366,92,Bruliam 2009 Doctor's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"The high score reflects the wine's potential, because it has been put on the market before it's ready to be opened. Fresh and zippy in acidity, its flavors are of raspberry and cherry pie filling, while sweet, caramelized oak has not yet been integrated. Cellar it for a year or two, even longer.

31371,92,Lachini 2006 Il Mulinello Klipsun Vineyard Red (Red Mountain),"This wine has been in release for almost two years, but the extra time has only improved it. Nicely melding the strengths of Klipsun vineyard Cabernet and Merlot with 24 months in half new, half year-old French oak barrels, this powerful wine has concentrated cherry and cassis fruit, potent baking spices, suggestions of mint and pepper, and a host of details waiting to be noticed.

The result is a substantial, even meaty red wine, muscular rather than plump. The fruit is layered and tart, its flavors laced with smoke, tar and licorice. The wine gathers strength in the midpalate, then gradually unfolds through the finish with polished tannins that are just slightly herbal.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,38.0,D2,Red Blend,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Washington,US,DeLille,,

35346,92,CVNE 2010 Viña Real Gran Reserva  (Rioja),"This is a young but excellent gran reserva, so it's gritty-smelling in its youth, with aromas of blackberry and cassis. Racy acidity pushes the focus on the palate towards the upper tier, while flavors of lactic oak, lemon peel, tobacco and mocha share the stage with plum and berry fruit. Finishing flavors of vanilla and raw oak are supported by good acidity and just enough pulp.

The wine gathers strength on the midpalate, finishing with a flourish of strawberry preserves.

The body is slender but the fruit notes have a honeyed quality, as befits a vintage Crémant.

Despite this vintage's reputation for offering ripe, forward, accessible flavors, this wine remains stubbornly closed. It's entirely possible that it has just hit a bit of a dumb phase, which is not uncommon for recently-bottled Pinot Noir.

35364,92,Fontes da Cunha 2013 Munda Touriga Nacional (Dão),"With 100% Touriga Nacional, this is a finely perfumed, ripe yet elegant wine.

Allowed in the appellation, the grape is only really found in this southern Aube region. It comes to the fore with Aurélien Gerbais (fourth generation), produced from vines planted in 1904.

Sourced from the Upland vineyard in the tiny Snipes Mountain AVA, it is bursting with pure, sweet fruit flavors, tart and lip-smackingly juicy.

35401,92,Chateau Montelena 2007 The Montelena Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Calistoga),"Not a wine for drinking now or anytime soon. It's so hard in tannins, it basically locks down the palate, and the astringency seems to accentuate the acidity and dryness.

37667,92,Rodney Strong 2004 Estate Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),"A very nice Cabernet, with a rich vein of tannins that gives it a crunchy texture, and forward black currant, cherry, and plum flavors that are as juicy as they come. Nearly 100% varietal Cab, it feels upscale and plush in the mouth, and gets better as it warms in the glass. Fair price for a Cab this good.",,,25.0,Estate Vineyards,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sonoma County,Sonoma,California,US,Rodney Strong,,
37668,92,Owen Roe 2006 The Kilmore Pinot Noir,"A sweet, supple, seductive Pinot that flirts with your palate. A bold display of ripe, sweet cherry fruit, followed by a flash of mint, a whiff of licorice, a streak of stone and a warm finish that suggests cola and sassafras. It gathers strength as it sits in the mouth, finishing with a flourish.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,42.0,The Kilmore,Pinot Noir,Willamette Valley,,Oregon,US,Owen Roe,,
37669,92,Goldeneye 2005 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Winemaker Zach Rasmuson did not produce a Narrows Vineyard bottling in 2005.

37884,92,Beaucanon 1998 Jacques de Connick Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"The best Napa Cabs are soft, concentrated and supple. This pretty wine is all that. It combines the power of sun-ripened fruit with a reluctance on the winemaker's part to overwhelm. This dry wine impresses through restraint, not a knock to the head. The right foods will make it sing.",,,65.0,Jacques de Connick,Cabernet Sauvignon,Napa Valley,Napa,California,US,Beaucanon,,
37885,92,E. Guigal 2000 La Doriane  (Condrieu),"Unlike so many Condrieus, this is a wine that needs to be aged. From a parcel of land in the south end of the Condrieu appellation, this vintage is currently dominated by new wood. But under that, there is elegant, spicy fruit with delicious flavors of ripe pears and peaches. Just a hint of acidity gives it structure and considerable potential for aging.",Roger Voss,@vossroger,60.0,La Doriane,Rhône-style White Blend,Condrieu,,Rhône Valley,France,E. Guigal,,
37886,92,Alain Graillot 1999 La Guiraude  (Crozes-Hermitage),"Alain Graillot, chemical industry executive turned farmer, is showing how good Crozes-Hermitage really can be. The 1999 vintage of his special cuvée, La Guiraude, is a powerful, but bright wine, full of red fruits and firm tannins and balancing acidity. Raisins and rich fruit join the mixture that goes to make an immediately enticing wine, but one that should age over the next 10 years.",Roger Voss,@vossroger,,La Guiraude,Syrah,Crozes-Hermitage,,Rhône Valley,France,Alain Graillot,,

37888,92,Quilceda Creek 1998 Merlot (Washington),"This extremely limited-production Merlot (about 250 cases) is Alex and Paul Golitzin's “other” great red. It's all Klipsun Vineyard fruit, 75% Merlot and 25% Cabernet, and its soft, chocolatey tannins envelope the taste buds in a sensual, textured landscape comprised of luscious cherry fruit and laced with hints of anise and roasted coffee. Big and extracted, yet more approachable than the Cabernet.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,60.0,,Merlot,Washington,Washington Other,Washington,US,Quilceda Creek,,
37889,92,Wineglass Cellars 1999 Elerding Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Yakima Valley),"This is an elegant, textured, subtle wine that will reward cellaring. Very fragrant and stylish, it shows smoky, dusty black cherry and cassis scents, ripe but not raisiny fruit, tightly wound and revealing hints of earth and mineral.

37891,92,Lambert Bridge 1998 Crane Creek Cuvee Red (Dry Creek Valley),"A really wonderful wine. It seems classic Dry Creek Valley, in terms of bright, spicy fruit, as polished as marble on the surface, with maybe less stuffing than, say, Napa. But that's not to put it down.

37894,92,DeLille 2000 Chaleur Estate White (Columbia Valley (WA)),"In this new vintage there is a bit more Sauvignon Blanc (69%) than usual; the rest is Sémillon. Rich, oaky and expansive, it is an oak and texture-driven style, with the fruit—clean, slightly herbaceous, spicy and tart—playing second fiddle. Which is no criticism, because the delicious, over-the-top flavors, with layer upon layer of creamy complexity, and the rich, buttery finish just beg for lobster in a cream or butter sauce.

37976,92,Vitesse 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A handful of Petit Verdot adds power and color to this wine, which opens in a dusty, rich bouquet of dark cherry. Compressed tannins give way to a concentration of pomegranate and cassis, the fruit grown predominantly on Spring Mountain. The finish captures mountainside minerality.

37980,92,Le Vieux Pin 2011 Équinoxe Syrah (Okanagan Valley),"Steely and compact, this rather reluctantly opens to reveal subtle complexity. The mix of tart blueberry and blackberry fruit is accompanied by scents of cured meat, menthol and garrigue.

37981,92,Leah Jørgensen Cellars 2014 Panner-Hanson Vineyard Loiregon Sauvignon Blanc (Rogue Valley),"This delightful and refreshing wine is atypical in all the right ways. Intensely aromatic, it conveys a lush mix of honeysuckle, sweet hay, smoke, lime and honeydew melon. And that's before you take the first sip.

43898,92,Franco Molino Cascina Rocca 2005 Villero Riserva  (Barolo),"Dark power and concentration mark the bouquet of this vineyard-designate Barolo Riserva.

44143,92,Château Malescot Saint-Exupery 2006  Margaux,"Finely structured, this has become an impressive wine, gaining in intensity as it develops.

44144,92,Chateau Rollat 2005 Rollat Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Rollat is the mid-level red wine of the three inaugural releases from Chateau Rollat. It's less brooding and compact than the companion Edouard Cabernet. Immediately accessible, it could almost be the template for this new and exciting producer; elegant, polished and supple with ripe sweet fruit and fine tannins. Flavors of black cherry and cassis envelop the palate, gently spreading out into a full-on fruit rainbow.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,38.0,Rollat,Cabernet Sauvignon,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Washington,US,Chateau Rollat,,
44145,92,Chateau Rollat 2006 Rollat Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Less immediately accessible than the 2005, the 2006 is tight and tart and almost seems encased in some sort of a shell. The fruit is concentrated raspberry and plum, and the acids taste natural while the tannins are polished and proportionate. The wine stays focused and strong through a very long finish that dapples in toasted coconut and chocolate malt. If you are a Rollat collector (and you should be) this would be the wine to cellar for five or six years, waiting for the Edouard to come into full flower.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,45.0,Rollat,Cabernet Sauvignon,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Washington,US,Chateau Rollat,,

44149,92,Amisfield 2007 Pinot Noir (Central Otago),"Amisfield has been on a hot streak, and the 2007 continues that roll. The aromas show wonderfully high-toned cherry fruit, with a slightly herbal element that adds welcome complexity.

Long and lush on the finish, this looks to be at its best now and for the next several years.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz,45.0,,Pinot Noir,,,Central Otago,New Zealand,Amisfield,,
44150,92,Château Haut-Bailly 2006  Pessac-Léognan,"You need to think ahead here, because this wine is currently totally dominated by wood. The richness and classic, balanced structure that is normal with Haut-Bailly seems to have been put aside in favor of a highly polished, toast-laden style. Search for the fruit and there is blackberry,spice and fruit tannin. But it's hard. Wait 10 years at least.",Roger Voss,@vossroger,,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Pessac-Léognan,,Bordeaux,France,Château Haut-Bailly,,
44151,92,Château Latour à Pomerol 2006  Pomerol,"Licorice, chocolate and black plums all show immediately in this rich, dense wine.

44152,92,Dumas Station 2005 Estate Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"A great effort, with mountain-grown fruit, high-altitude acids that give the flavors shape and cut, tightening up and brightening up the sharp, wild berry fruit.

44153,92,Schloss Johannisberger 2006 Rosalack Auslese Riesling (Rheingau),"Now that this famous estate is turning out stellar wines once again, the only problem remaining is the pricing. This auslese features slaty, minerally aromas touched with hints of honey and quince, then opens up on the palate to reveal honey, pear, melon and even a hint of peach, all undergirded by a bedrock of minerality.

44156,92,Kracher 2005 Zwischen den Seen Nummer 4 Trockenbeerenauslese Scheurebe (Burgenland),"Kracher TBA wines are numbered in ascending order of intensity. Even at this medium level of intensity, this is an impressive wine. It has that fine balance, pushing its rich marmalade and dried apricot flavors right up to intense acidity.

44158,92,Honker Blanc 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"This is one of the best values in Sauvignon Blanc, or any white wine, of this year. It's completely satisfying, giving Loire-like minerality and acidity with ripe Napa flavors of spearmint, lemons and limes, figs and spices that finish thoroughly dry.

44160,92,Les Astéries 2006  Saint-Émilion,"As a contrast to Jonathan Maltus's Le Carré, this single-vineyard wine, from vines situated only 100 yards away, has a taut, mineral flavor, with an initial austere character which then opens out to give dark bitter chocolate and plum skin flavors. It is potentially a richer, more impressive wine, but it needs aging for 4–5 years.",Roger Voss,@vossroger,135.0,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Saint-Émilion,,Bordeaux,France,Les Astéries,,
44161,92,Miner 2005 Petite Sirah (Napa Valley),"This is a serious red wine, powerful and authoritative in Petite Sirah character, but be forewarned, it's pretty tannic, and nowhere near ready. That probably won't stop most folks from popping the cork now, and they'll like the blackberry, currant and dark chocolate flavors just fine withgrilled steaks and chops. But the wine will develop fascinating bottle complexities for many years.",,,40.0,,Petite Sirah,Napa Valley,Napa,California,US,Miner,,
44162,92,Morgan 2006 Garys' Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Acidity marks this fresh, young wine, giving a tension to the mouthfeel, and suggesting some time in the bottle to round it out.

44163,92,Morgan 2006 Rosella's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Very similar to last year's bottling, Morgan's '06 is pale in color, dry, silky and a little aloof. It's like a shy person who opens up when you get to know them. With firm acidity framing cranberry, rose petal, red cherry, grilled mushroom and spice flavors, it should begin to open up in a year or so.",,,62.0,Rosella's Vineyard,Pinot Noir,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,California,US,Morgan,,
44164,92,Williams Selyem 2006 Bucher Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Fairly tannic, this lovely Pinot Noir has a dusty, dry astringency that tamps down the palate's enjoyment of the fruit, and suggests aging. Yet the vast flavors range from cherries, pomegranates and persimmons to the cola and Asian spices that always characterize WS Pinots.

44165,92,Chaleur Estate 2007 Blanc White (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Make no mistake—the model for this wine can be found among the classified growth white wines of Bordeaux. The barrel influences are many and varied, layering in a mix of smoke, caramel and cracker; and the fruit is supple and beautifully blended. White raisins, Asian pears, pineapple and peaches blend together gracefully, and the alcohol remains at a moderate 13.8%.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,35.0,Blanc,White Blend,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Washington,US,Chaleur Estate,,
44166,92,Château Branaire-Ducru 2006  Saint-Julien,"Taking advantage of the delicious fruit of 2006, this Branaire-Ducru shows a charming side. It brings out ripe, spicy black plums and black cherry spice to go with the lively, fresh tannins. That's not to say that there isn't structure, but today it is the fruit that dominates.",Roger Voss,@vossroger,,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Saint-Julien,,Bordeaux,France,Château Branaire-Ducru,,
44167,92,Château de Malle 2006  Sauternes,"A beautifully dense wine, concentrated and ripe.

44168,92,Château Pavie Macquin 2006  Saint-Émilion,"A lovely, fresh, juicy wine that has a delightful lilt to its fruit. Red and black berries intermingle easily with a core of firm tannins.

This is a finely structured wine, already well developed.",Roger Voss,@vossroger,,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Saint-Émilion,,Bordeaux,France,Château Pavie Macquin,,
44169,92,Château Providence 2006  Pomerol,"Christian Moueix's new property is already showing its potential. In the second vintage under his control, it is producing a huge, dense wine, with black cherry juice, blackberry and bitter cocoa flavors.

44171,92,Chapelle d'Ausone 2006  Saint-Émilion,"The second wine of Château Ausone is an impressive younger brother. It has the same density and suavity, but the fruits are fresher, lighter. Those fruits go right through the firm tannins, leaving spice and delicious, juicy flavors. It is a complete wine, showing all the exuberant freshness of 2006.",Roger Voss,@vossroger,,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Saint-Émilion,,Bordeaux,France,Chapelle d'Ausone,,

44247,92,Carpineto 2006 Riserva  (Vino Nobile di Montepulciano),"Carpineto's Vino Nobile Riserva is almost too much of a good thing with its rich density, bold intensity and big aromas of ripe blackberry, leather, exotic spice and tobacco.

44249,92,Chappellet 2010 Signature Chenin Blanc (Napa Valley),"Racy and brisk, clean and tart, this shows Meyer lemon, lime, white peach, mineral and white pepper aromas.

One of the best California Chenin Blancs in recent years.",,,30.0,Signature,Chenin Blanc,Napa Valley,Napa,California,US,Chappellet,,
44250,92,Quinola 2008  Toro,"This is a serious Toro wine with smooth, dark, leathery aromas along with hints of wintergreen, licorice and berry pastry.

44251,92,Robert Mondavi 2010 Reserve Chardonnay (Carneros),"This bottling always strives to avoid a heavy hand and express more of a terroir-driven Chardonnay.

44254,92,Super Sonoman 2007 Meritage (Sonoma County),"Dry, rich and intricate, this is clearly capable of aging.

44352,92,Chateau St. Jean 2006 Cinq Cépages Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County),"Showing the usual balance and harmony of this bottling, which is made from the five Bordeaux varieties, the '06 nonetheless lacks a bit of the richness of other vintages. It's beautifully clean and dry, with sound currant, blackberry, herb tea and cedar flavors, but is missing a certain fatness in the middle.

44353,92,Demetria 2007 Cuvée Constantine Red (Santa Ynez Valley),"Interesting flavors in this dry Rhône-style blend of Grenache, Mourvèdre and Syrah. They range from cherries, red currants and raspberries to teriaki beef, bacon, cola and buttered cinnamon toast, with all sorts of exotic Asian spices. It's quite a tannic wine, and very dry. Shows a certain nobility, but you'll want to decant it, even overnight, to let it breathe.",,,40.0,Cuvée Constantine,Rhône-style Red Blend,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,California,US,Demetria,,

44355,92,Ken Wright 2008 Abbott Claim Vineyard Pinot Noir,"The 2008 Pinots from Ken Wright display their individual terroirs quite succinctly, with little evidence of the (roughly) 30% new oak they receive. The Abbott Claim has a bit more of a chocolaty flavor, with full, spicy cherry fruit at its core. In fact there is so much fruit, spicy and candied, that it is a bit like fruitcake, in a good way.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,50.0,Abbott Claim Vineyard,Pinot Noir,Willamette Valley,,Oregon,US,Ken Wright,,
44356,92,Landmark 2008 Kanzler Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"With Pinot Noir, texture is everything, and this lovely wine is pure silk and satin. That makes it drinkable now, with its pretty flavors of raspberries, cherries, cola, cinnamon butter and sandalwood. But it's also tannicly tough, with a sandpapery scour.

44357,92,Merry Edwards 2007 Coopersmith Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Tough and chewy now, with a fibrous, tannic mouthfeel like a bite of beef jerky. Similar flavors, too, of teriaki beef, but the underlying fruit is massive, offering waves of cherries, black raspberries, currants and cola. This is a very fine wine, but an immature one. Give it 4–6 years in the cellar, if you can keep your hands off.",,,54.0,Coopersmith,Pinot Noir,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,California,US,Merry Edwards,,
44358,92,Morgan 2007 Hat Trick Double L Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Marked by a lean minerality, this Chablis-style wine is not one of those fat, opulent Chards that dazzles with sheer richness. It's more subtle than that, and more acidic. Structure, in fact, is the name of the game here, with its lemon and lime flavors that barely break into green apples. Fine now, if not served too cold, and for the next 2–4 years. Beyond that, wines of this kind go quickly downhill.",,,65.0,Hat Trick Double L Vineyard,Chardonnay,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,California,US,Morgan,,
44359,92,Bellavista 2004 Gran Cuvée Brut Rosé Sparkling (Franciacorta),"Here's a pale pink sparkler that would serve beautifully at weddings and special outdoor occasions.

44361,92,Château Doisy-Daëne 2007  Barsac,"The color is light on this wine, which is really only just beginning to show richness.

44362,92,Chehalem 2008 Corral Creek Riesling (Chehalem Mountains),"Very consistent in style with previous vintages, this textural, lemony, racy Riesling seems bone dry, though it is noted as having 1% residual sugar. Along with rich flavors of grapefruit and citrus, there are nectarine and pear fruit highlights and a sharp minerality.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,24.0,Corral Creek,Riesling,Chehalem Mountains,Willamette Valley,Oregon,US,Chehalem,,

44786,92,Kingston Family 2015 Bayo Oscuro Syrah (Casablanca Valley),"Dusty aromas of tea and dried spices blend well with black olive and black-fruit notes. This wine has a lean but muscular build.

44788,92,Lazy Creek 2016 Gewürztraminer (Anderson Valley),"Quite dry and reserved in flavor, this wine is intriguing: subtle rose petal and mineral notes, medium body and a bite of grapefruit zest on the finish that begs for another sip. One of the earliest producers of Gewürztraminer wines in Anderson Valley, it's still one of the best.",Jim Gordon,@gordone_cellars,22.0,,Gewürztraminer,Anderson Valley,,California,US,Lazy Creek,,
44789,92,Les Vignobles Gueissard 2015 Cuvée G Red (Côtes de Provence),"This is a superbly rich wine that is packed with generous black fruits and balanced acidity.

45041,92,Tangent 2011 Paragon Vineyard Viognier (Edna Valley),"As Barbara Streisand might have said, “Hello, gorgeous.” With brisk acidity that's almost tingly, this is basically dry, yet the exotic tropical fruit, peach and honeysuckle flavors are so pure, ending with a sweet finish. It's the perfect accompaniment to Asian-fusion fare.",,,17.0,Paragon Vineyard,Viognier,Edna Valley,Central Coast,California,US,Tangent,,
45042,92,Tenuta Chiccheri 2007 Vigneto di Campo delle Strie  (Amarone della Valpolicella),"The toasted oak aromas are still evident on the nose, so give this a few more years to unwind before opening.

45272,92,Dry Creek Vineyard 2006 The Mariner Red (Dry Creek Valley),"Shows the edgy tannins that Dry Creek red wines invariably display, with a sandpapery texture. That makes the wine, which is a Bordeaux blend of five varieties, a little rustic. But the dryness and bite are a nice alternative to the riper, softer Napa style, and more versatile at the table. Good now, and should slowly develop in the bottle for years.",,,40.0,The Mariner,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,California,US,Dry Creek Vineyard,,

45276,92,Hartenberg 2006 The Stork Shiraz (Stellenbosch),"While this is certainly on the higher end of South African Shiraz price points, it's worth the investment. The intense bouquet is loaded with rich dark cherry, raspberry, sweet spice and small wild strawberries. All-spice and pepper dominate the creamy mouth, with opulent flavors of meaty plum, roasted espresso and black cherry guts. Full and powerful in the mouth with a strong vanilla-accented finish.

45278,92,Zaca Mesa 2007 Roussanne (Santa Ynez Valley),"Bone dry, ultra-crisp in acidity, and lean in mineral flavors, this barrel-fermented, lees-aged Roussanne is the opposite of rich.

45285,92,Château Peyros 2003 Cuvée Greenwich Tannat (Madiran),"The name refers to the fact that Madiran is on the Greenwich Meridian of zero degrees longitude. The wine, from a single parcel, is bold and black in character and color.

46843,92,Swanson 2007 Alexis Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"Made with 19% Merlot, this Cabernet's tannins are quite hard and firm, giving it a tight astringency. Even so, the underlying fruit is so powerful, it breaks through in a mouthburst of blackberries, black cherries, black raspberries and an oaky, smoky richness that's almost chocolaty. A very fine, intense and ageworthy wine that should develop bottle complexity over the next decade or more.",,,75.0,Alexis,Cabernet Sauvignon,Oakville,Napa,California,US,Swanson,,

It's as rich and ripe as they get, bursting with fresh raspberries, cherries and mocha, and that briary, brambly quality of wild forest nettles. Yet it's thoroughly dry, with thick, refined tannins.

48227,92,Le Morette 2015 Mandolara  (Lugana),"Exquisite floral aromas of honeysuckle and jasmine are joined by a whiff of mature pear.

48228,92,Lucas & Lewellen 2012 Cote del Sol Estate Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Ynez Valley),"This stellar bottling deftly combines both the bright and burned sides of the sipping experience, offering fresh crushed blueberries alongside caramel, cooked dark chocolate and charred toast on the nose. There's a great array of dried herbs once sipped, with flavors of dried blueberries, lamb char, espresso and pencil lead. Tons of depth.",Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann,36.0,Cote del Sol Estate Vineyards,Cabernet Sauvignon,Santa Ynez Valley,Central Coast,California,US,Lucas & Lewellen,,
48229,92,Luigi Bosca 2013 Gala 1 Malbec-Petit Verdot-Tannat Red (Mendoza),"This Malbec-led blend (with Petit Verdot and Tannat) is muscular and piercing on the nose, with aromas of brick dust, black cherry, cassis and raisin. The palate is saturated and creamy, with a lactic sensation competing with rubbery tannins. Flavors of vanilla, raw oak, tomato, plum, herbs and chocolate are complex and finish with multiple interest points along with mild heat. Give this more time, if possible. Best from 2018 through 2022.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach,38.0,Gala 1 Malbec-Petit Verdot-Tannat,Red Blend,Mendoza,,Mendoza Province,Argentina,Luigi Bosca,,
48230,92,Vigne Marina Coppi 2013 Fausto Timorasso (Colli Tortonesi),"Fresh and elegantly structured, this opens with aromas of Spanish broom, acacia flower, citrus peel and a whiff of hazelnut. The vibrant, full-bodied palate offers citrus zest, beeswax, almond and a honeyed note alongside bright acidity. A mineral accent gives it a clean, focused finish. Hold for even more complexity.

48231,92,Grey Wolf Cellars 2014 Sentinelle White (Central Coast),"Very inviting aromas of lemon curd, buttercream, white peach and pear blossom prove quite ripe but far from overdone on this blend of 40% Roussanne, 40% Marsanne and 20% Viognier. There is thinly focused but prevalent acidity to the sip, where peaches, lemon and cream flavos thrive. A well balanced and rich white Rhône blend, which is harder to pull off than it sounds.",Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann,24.0,Sentinelle,Rhône-style White Blend,Central Coast,Central Coast,California,US,Grey Wolf Cellars,,
48232,92,Huia 2015 Estate Grown Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"This wine harmoniously blends hints of cut grass and struck flint with pink grapefruit.

48233,92,Jaffurs 2012 Grenache (Santa Barbara County),"Clean and tight aromas of strawberry essence mesh with dried violets, rose petals, star anise and clove on this engaging while classically profiled bottling. It's light and lively on the palate, with tons of bright red fruit and cinnamon spice, showing cranberry tang in the midpalate and the structural bones to hold up its energetic game for years.",Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann,34.0,,Grenache,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,California,US,Jaffurs,,
48234,92,Goat Bubbles 2013 Blanc de Noirs Clos Pepe Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Creamy bubbles rise through hay color in the glass, showing the slightest touch of salmon pink on the edges, with a lean and tight nose that shows tortilla dough, pink grapefruit rind and a sleek, steely gunmetal note. Crisp apple and sliced Meyer lemon flavors show on the palate, where the bubbles are foamy, the yeast is present but restrained and the style is very approachable.",Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann,60.0,Blanc de Noirs Clos Pepe Vineyard,Pinot Noir,Sta.

48235,92,Bodega Norton 2012 Privada Red (Mendoza),"This Bordeaux-style blend screams out friendly, from its warm, earthy bouquet of marzipan, earth and black fruits to its flush, layered palate to flavors of plum, berry, chocolate and fig.

48236,92,Bodega Rolland 2011 Mariflor Michel Rolland Malbec (Mendoza),"Concentrated blackberry and desert brush aromas are dense and intense.

48238,92,Beringer 2014 Luminus Chardonnay (Oak Knoll District),"There's an honest suggestion of bacon and eggs at first in this wine, which follows with a tangy entry that sizzles on the palate. Full, luscious and honeyed in oak, it's a powerful expression that's also balanced between fruit and nuance.",Virginie Boone,@vboone,39.0,Luminus,Chardonnay,Oak Knoll District,Napa,California,US,Beringer,,
48239,92,Calera 2014 Chardonnay (Central Coast),"Josh Jensen's appellation blend is arguably the best American white wine for the price. This vintage offers squeezed tangerine, fleur de sel, lily, apple blossom, apple fritters and a touch of tropicality on the nose. The palate is more steely in structure, with chalk and concrete minerality followed by grapefruit skin and lime flavors, revealing the slightest hint of balanced butter tones.",Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann,20.0,,Chardonnay,Central Coast,Central Coast,California,US,Calera,,
48240,92,Cantina del Pino 2011 Ovello  (Barbaresco),"Aromas of mature dark berry, leather, black spice and a whiff of tar come together on this full-bodied red.

48247,92,Gruber Röschitz 2015 Hundspoint Grüner Veltliner (Weinviertel),"Yellow grapefruit peel, crushed white peppercorns and fresh chervil paint a picture of a quintessential Grüner here: flavorsome but not heavy, concentrated but slender, easy to enjoy but never facile. More ripe pear fruit lurks temptingly at the core while that grapefruit theme is utterly convincing and captivating.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino,16.0,Hundspoint,Grüner Veltliner,,,Weinviertel,Austria,Gruber Röschitz,,
48272,92,Albert Bichot 2005 Domaine Long-Depaquit Les Vaucopins Premier Cru  (Chablis),"A very vibrant, lively wine, all mineral and fresh acidity.

48273,92,Cuvaison 2005 Block F5 Pinot Noir (Carneros),"This is easily Cuvaison's best Pinot Noir ever. It's not only delicious right out of the bottle, it's an ager. Really flatters the palate with appealing cherry, black raspberry, cola and tangerine fruit, wrapped in a silky texture. Yet it shows a dense, tightly tannic quality that suggest up to 8 years in the cellar.",,,45.0,Block F5,Pinot Noir,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,California,US,Cuvaison,,
48274,92,Williams Selyem 2005 Allen Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"The very fine Allen Vineyard, on Westside Road in the tenderloin of the appellation, has produced a high-quality Chardonnay that is capable of some bottle aging.

48275,92,Jean-Marc Brocard 2005 Vaulorent Premier Cru  (Chablis),"Regarded in Chablis as almost a grand cru vineyard, Vaulorent has produced a superconcentrated wine, layering minerals, yellow fruits and pear skin structure touched lightly by caramel. There is great acidity throughout this impressive wine.",Roger Voss,@vossroger,,Vaulorent Premier Cru,Chardonnay,Chablis,,Burgundy,France,Jean-Marc Brocard,,
48276,92,Kunde 2004 202 Meritage (Sonoma Valley),"A new bottling from Kunde, and one of their most successful reds ever. A Cabernet-Merlot blend, it shows earthy, tobacco-edged flavors of cherries, raspberries, blackberries, carob, vanilla and cedar.

48278,92,Chehalem 2005 Corral Creek Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"A single-vineyard wine from Oregon can be a component rather than a complete wine, but here it is an absolute joy. Fragrant and complex, this offers pleasures for both nose and palate, with scents of leaf and spice and herb, leading into a surprisingly dense and textural blend of wild berry, rhubarb, melon and mixed tropical fruits. Fascinating and long, this is a fine example of Oregon Pinot at its most elegant and fascinating.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,44.0,Corral Creek Vineyard,Pinot Noir,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Oregon,US,Chehalem,,

48280,92,Hendry 2004 Block 28 Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"Celebrates its lusty volume proudly as a big, gutsy Zinfandel that makes no apology for high alcohol and extract. The flavors are huge, of ripe blackberries, loganberries, mulberries, red licorice, figs, black olives, Asian spices and oak, but despite all that, the wine finishes fully dry and balanced.

48282,92,Alexander Valley Vineyards 2004 Alexander School Top of the Crop Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"This is a limited-production line from this venerable winery. It's a very dense, focused Cab, a little too tightly wound to pop the cork quite yet. There's a sharp pine or balsam zinginess that's a combination of smoky oak and deeply ripe cassis, fresh and zesty and dry. The wine needs time for all this to mellow. Best after 2008, and for a decade beyond.",,,35.0,Alexander School Top of the Crop,Cabernet Sauvignon,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,California,US,Alexander Valley Vineyards,,
48283,92,Brandlin 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mount Veeder),"Other wineries have produced very good vineyard-designated Cabs from this mountain property. Now Brandlin has a go, and the wine shows promise. It's considerably more tannic than most expensive New Age Napa Cabs, so dry and astringent that it demands cellar time. But it should develop, to judge from the powerful core of black currant fruit. Best after 2008 and through 2012, at least.",,,85.0,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Mount Veeder,Napa,California,US,Brandlin,,

48285,92,Leeuwin Estate 2002 Art Series Cabernet Sauvignon (Margaret River),"Perhaps better known for its Chardonnay, Leeuwin also makes an Art Series Cabernet that takes a back seat to no one. The 2002 still boasts youthful scents of fresh mint and cassis, then slowly unfolds on the palate to reveal a rich, full-bodied wine with a distinctly ripe, creamy texture.

48286,92,Valley of the Moon 2004 Cuvée de la Luna Red (Sonoma County),"Valley of the Moon hasn't raised the price on this Bordeaux blend for years, which makes it a value for the complexity you get. This isn't one of those soft, mushy wines that's all flavor and no structure.

48287,92,William Fèvre 2005 Les Lys Premier Cru  (Chablis),"This is a rare premier cru vineyard with its north-east exposure. In good years, like 2005, it can produce a wonderful expression of the mineral structure of fine Chablis.

48288,92,Williams Selyem 2005 Forchini Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley),"This single-vineyard Zin is a considerable improvement over the ‘04. The alcohol in the ‘05 is far lower, almost a full percent, yielding a more balanced and harmonious wine. But it's hardly shy. It's powerful in wild blackberry, cassis, raspberry, root beer, tangerine, chocolate and sweet thyme, while the tannic structure is rich enough to warrant bottle aging for a decade.",,,45.0,Forchini Vineyard,Zinfandel,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,California,US,Williams Selyem,,
48289,92,Pascal Bouchard 2004 Les Clos Grand Cru  (Chablis),"A solid, firmly structured, mineral wine, buoyed up by wood. It is very intense, nervous, just poised between richness and power.

48290,92,Stony Hill 2005 Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"Here's one of those rare California Chards that needs time. The wine is tight, tough and minerally in its youth, with an austerity of flavors suggesting Meyer lemons, nectarines and flint.

48293,92,La Chablisienne 2005 Vaulorent Premier Cru  (Chablis),"La Chablisienne vinifies this portion of Fourchaume premier cru separately, regarding it as almost grand cru in power.

50538,92,Maysara 2005 Mitra Pinot Noir (McMinnville),"It is rare to find a high-end domestic Pinot Noir so restrained, so elegant. Lightly layered with tangy raspberry, mineral and herb, this wine proves that supple, graceful, complex, delicious Pinots can be made in Oregon.

50989,92,Bouchard Père & Fils 2007 Les Porrets Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges),"Tough and defiantly tannic, a hard-edged wine that gives a powerful dry texture.

50994,92,Elyse 2005 Morisoli Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"The vineyard is in the heart of the Rutherford bench. The wine is rich in fruit and tannins, but a bit clumsy, with a chunky, tannic mouthfeel and jammy, direct blackberry and blueberry fruit flavors.

51010,92,Domaine Barmès-Buecher 2015 Rosenberg Vieilles Vignes Sylvaner (Alsace),"A lovely mix of aromas appears on the nose: a touch of sandalwood amidst fresh greenery—something at once sonorous and very fresh.

51011,92,Domaine Ostertag 2015 Les Vieilles Vignes Sylvaner (Alsace),"Brilliant, crystalline freshness tinged with chervil and lemon is the impression on the nose. The palate is rounder than the nose suggests but has the same brilliance and lightness of flavor. Sylvaner is an underrrated grape that is all about subtlety and herbal nuance.

51944,92,ONX 2011 Mad Crush Red (Paso Robles),"This is one of ONX's drier, leaner wines. Blended from Grenache, Tempranillo and Mourvèdre, the raspberry and red currant flavors are grounded with notes of roasted meat, leather and tobacco. It's a fascinating, elegant wine to drink over the next few years.",,,45.0,Mad Crush,Red Blend,Paso Robles,Central Coast,California,US,ONX,,
51945,92,Porter Family Vineyards 2010 Syrah (Napa Valley),"This superb Syrah, is a great followup to the 2009 bottling. There are incredibly ripe flavors of blackberry jam, currant, chocolate and toast, along with notes of grilled bacon and black pepper. The tannins are so rich and fine, you can drink this wine now.",,,49.0,,Syrah,Napa Valley,Napa,California,US,Porter Family Vineyards,,
51946,92,Pratsch 2012 Steinberg Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),"An aroma of fresh, green Bartlett-pear peel comes first, then the riper notion of pear compote, with a grippy, lime-zest accent and a dash of pepper. Waves of flavor unfold on the tongue and give exquisite length. It has ample mileage to develop; enjoy it now while primary and zippy or wait for mellowed richness later. Either way, it belongs on the table. Drink 2014–2020.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino,24.0,Steinberg,Grüner Veltliner,,,Niederösterreich,Austria,Pratsch,,
51947,92,Rodney Strong 2010 Alexander's Crown Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"This Cabernet is immediately succulent, with smooth tannins, gorgeous layers of oak, and intricate flavors of blackberries, black cherries, plums and mocha. The alcohol is high, giving this 100% Cabernet some heat, but it should pair well with char-broiled steak.",,,75.0,Alexander's Crown,Cabernet Sauvignon,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,California,US,Rodney Strong,,
51948,92,Rusack 2012 Reserve Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),"This reserve wine was made from grapes grown in the same Bien Nacido and Sierra Madre vineyards as Rusack's regular 2012 Chardonnay, but it was produced in much smaller quantities, and it's a distinctly richer wine. Aged in ample new French oak, it has a toasty, caramelized opulence that the underlying tropical fruit, apricot, pear and citrus flavors are easily able to handle.",,,32.0,Reserve,Chardonnay,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,California,US,Rusack,,
51949,92,Santa Carolina 2009 Herencia Carmenère (Peumo),"Keeping with past performances, Herencia is again one of Chile's best Carmenères. This is bold, toasty and ripe on the nose, with tobacco and vanilla nuances. The palate is huge but in shape, while toasty, chocolaty flavors of herbal plum and berry end chewy, stacked and deep. Drink through 2016.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach,90.0,Herencia,Carmenère,,,Peumo,Chile,Santa Carolina,,
51950,92,Santa Rita 2008 Triple C Red (Maipo Valley),"Dry, leafy, herbal aromas come with berry power and spice. Triple C stands for Cabernets Franc and Sauvignon as well as Carmenère. This is a wide load on the palate, with smooth tannins and savory, roasted berry flavors that lead to a finish boasting chocolate, leather, spice and baked berry notes. Drink through 2017.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach,40.0,Triple C,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,,,Maipo Valley,Chile,Santa Rita,,

51952,92,Schloss Gobelsburg 2011 Haide Zweigelt (Niederösterreich),"This is a Zweigelt with an identity crisis that thinks it may be Pinot Noir. It's elegant and silky, with a gentle tannic touch, refreshing acidity and restrained but evocative redcurrant and cranberry fruit. Overtones of peony and iris make this more intriguing, while there is substance despite its light body. This is delicious now, but will reward cellaring for one to two years to let earthy, tertiary flavors develop. Drink from 2014.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino,36.0,Haide,Zweigelt,,,Niederösterreich,Austria,Schloss Gobelsburg,,
51953,92,Simonsig 2011 Redhill Pinotage (Stellenbosch),"A decadent blend of ripe berries and rich oak characterizes this wine; sweet smoke and baking spice mingle harmoniously with notes of mashed raspberry and blackberry, accented by hints of hickory-cured bacon and raw cocoa nibs. The medium-weight mouth is structured and bold, with chewy tannins and heady flavors of plum and berry preserves, roasted coffee and sweet licorice. The finish is long and dry, and although this would certainly benefit from 5–10 years of cellaring time, it's approachable now with decanting.",Lauren Buzzeo,@laurbuzz,38.0,Redhill,Pinotage,,,Stellenbosch,South Africa,Simonsig,,
51954,92,Fairview 2008 The Beacon Shiraz (Paarl),"This wine is immediately attractive, with initial aromas of ripe cherry, plum and berry fruits that are spiced with hints of Thin Mint, licorice and black pepper. Plush, but not overdone, the mouthfeel is like crushed velvet, with black cherry-skin and raspberry flavors and fine yet structured tannins.

It is ready to drink.",Roger Voss,@vossroger,40.0,,Rhône-style Red Blend,Bandol,,Provence,France,Chateau de Pibarnon,,
51978,92,Law 2013 Intrepid Syrah (Paso Robles),"This is a powerful bottling, as is expected by this producer, showing fresh boysenberry, purple flower potpourri, tart black plums and a touch of rosemary on the nose. It's undeniably delicious at first sip, with caramelized blackberry and hints of thyme and rosemary. The texture is squeaky and sticky, and it's a bit sweet and boozy, but a definite Paso crowd-pleaser.",Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann,750.0,Intrepid,Syrah,Paso Robles,Central Coast,California,US,Law,,
51979,92,Le Cadeau 2015 Rocheux Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"The name refers to the rocks in this section of the estate vineyard, and they can be felt as well as tasted in the wine. The mouthfeel is slightly astringent, with hints of metal and stone, and the alcohol is muted, allowing the more subtle suggestions of citrus and beet and truffle and wild strawberry to emerge. All in all it's the most complex and intriguing of the winery's offerings, and merits your full attention.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,50.0,Rocheux,Pinot Noir,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Oregon,US,Le Cadeau,,
51980,92,Maximin Grünhäuser 2015 Herrenberg Riesling (Mosel),"Sunny tangerine acidity highlights the rounded, slightly creamy mouthfeel of this light-bodied dry Riesling. Bright grapefruit and quince flavors are forward and fresh, offset by stony mineral tones that linger on the finish. It's a delicate yet richly balanced wine to enjoy now though 2025.",Anna Lee C. Iijima,,42.0,Herrenberg,Riesling,,,Mosel,Germany,Maximin Grünhäuser,,
51981,92,Morandé 2013 Vigno Old Vines Dry-Farmed Carignan (Maule Valley),"This blend of 78% Carignan, 18% Syrah and 4% Chardonnay deals a complete aromatic package of marzipan, fine oak and smooth berry fruits.

51983,92,Patel 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"Medium in weight and structure, this wine shows a tempting leanness at first, balancing its ripeness with complex notions of clove, cola and black cherry. Twisted in tannin and oak on the midpalate, its youthfulness on full display, it has a succulent finish.",Virginie Boone,@vboone,175.0,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Rutherford,Napa,California,US,Patel,,
51984,92,Paul O'Brien 2015 Bone Dry Riesling (Umpqua Valley),"The winery has stuck with a deeply austere, penetrating and rather Germanic style of dry Riesling—which is difficult to do this well. Though built for acid freaks, it's also layered with complex flavors, blending citrus pith and rind, wet stone, green apple and green pineapple. It's drinking well already, and likely to hold steady for up to a decade.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,26.0,Bone Dry,Riesling,Umpqua Valley,Southern Oregon,Oregon,US,Paul O'Brien,,
51985,92,Polkura 2013 Syrah (Marchigue),"Composed, cool aromas of marzipan, vanilla, boysenberry and cassis are touched up by controlled oak. This feels cushioned but with pop and tannic grab. Dark peppery herbal black-fruit flavors come with a chocolaty component, while this tastes of herbs and chocolate cake on a bold oaky finish. Drink through 2022.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach,23.0,,Syrah,,,Marchigue,Chile,Polkura,,
51986,92,Beaulieu Vineyard 1997 Clone 6 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Very tasty and large in scale, it sports a huge nose of dark plum and heavy cedar, along with cinnamon and vanilla accents wrapped in very toasty oak. Very dark fruit with licorice shadings and an elegant, supple mouthfeel add to the appeal.

51987,92,Laleure-Piot 1998 Premier Cru Les Vergelesses  (Pernand-Vergelesses),"Exemplary in all areas, from the smoke, mushroom and berry nose to the exotic undertones of island spice and fine oak supporting vibrant raspberry fruit.

For very good Burgundy that clicks on all cylinders, this is it.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach,33.0,Premier Cru Les Vergelesses,Pinot Noir,Pernand-Vergelesses,,Burgundy,France,Laleure-Piot,,
51988,92,Clark-Claudon 1997 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A full load of berry fruit in the nose, black-currant flavors and extremely even balance. It features an attractive set of cherry and cassis flavors, and the heavy tannins that hit home on the long finish, while fairly starching, don't stand in the way of the overall pleasure it gives.",,,78.0,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Napa Valley,Napa,California,US,Clark-Claudon,,
51989,92,St. Supéry 1997 Dollarhide Ranch Limited Editi Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Blackberry aromas have a Port-like character and a smoky undertone.

51990,92,Signorello 1997 Padrone Red (Napa Valley),"Cassis liqueur, blueberry notes and a smoky cured-meat element comprise the nose of this engaging, beautifully balanced offering. Dried cherry, cedar, tea and tobacco flavors predominate, and the texture is supple. The long finish displays handsome cherry and coffee notes, with plentiful but even tannins.

51992,92,Robert Craig 1997 Affinity Red (Napa Valley),"Full, with lots of structure, this offers concentrated grape and blackberry aromas that open to black-currant and cedar-spice flavors. A fine fruit-acid balance on the full, even palate keeps it lively, even in its fairly youthful and closed state. Dusty tannins and sweet-and-sour black fruits on the long but tight finish close this appealing package.",,,44.0,Affinity,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Napa Valley,Napa,California,US,Robert Craig,,
51993,92,Lancaster 1997 Reserve Red (Sonoma County),"Ultraripe berry, herb, cedar, and toast aromas. Refined plum, licorice, and coffee flavors show great appeal, and the supple, elegant mouthfeel plays into the finish with dark fruit and cocoa-powder notes.

51994,92,Liparita 1997 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Herbs and toast play off the standard fare of blackberries and plums, creating a good whole. It's full, deep, and long—a thoroughbred. Another of those wines that everyone with a taste for California Cabernet should like. Charming and high in quality, if not necessarily ultracomplex.",,,45.0,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Napa Valley,Napa,California,US,Liparita,,
51995,92,St. Clement 1997 Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),"Foster's should be a happy new owner of this property.

51996,92,Staglin 1997 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"A youthful, exciting wine that offers plenty of earth and cassis. It seems tight and closed now, with packed in tannins, a condensed mouthfeel and some mild green pepper notes on the tail end. Definitely a wine for the cellar.

51997,92,Nickel & Nickel 1997 John C. Sullenger Vyd Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"Another in the new N&N; line, the Sullenger features red and black fruit, herbs, some earth, and an appealing whiff of sautéed pancetta or bacon.

51999,92,Spring Mountain Vineyard 1997 Reserve Red,"Another wine in what we have come to call the “black-beauty” style. It has heavily toasted oak, espresso, black cherry and menthol aromas and flavors. The fruit seems subdued here, but the wine is nevertheless well integrated, with a full mouthfeel and long finish.

52656,92,Stéphane Aviron 2014 Vieilles Vignes  (Juliénas),"Produced from two separate vineyards, the wine has all the concentration of old vines.

52657,92,Syncline 2014 Heart of the Hill Vineyard Mourvèdre (Red Mountain),"This variety is still a rarity in the state, with vineyard-designated offerings even more so. Aromas of cherry, mortared herb and mineral are followed by focused tightly wound black-fruit flavors that persist on the finish. It appears to show a bit more oak influence than the winery is typically known for but still delivers the goods.",Sean P.

52658,92,Talbott 2014 Logan Sleepy Hollow Vineyard Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"This offers a great taste of an iconic vineyard for less than $30.

52662,92,La Honda Winery 2015 Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Key-lime rinds, pink grapefruit, crisp pluot, just-ripe pineapple, nectarine and a steely gunmetal aroma show on the nose of this bottling. There's an intriguing touch of sweet onion to the sip. The laser-sharp precision would pair well with shellfish, but a slightly buttered warmth makes the bottling quite versatile.",Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann,26.0,,Chardonnay,Santa Cruz Mountains,Central Coast,California,US,La Honda Winery,,
52663,92,Laughing Stock 2014 Blind Trust Red (Okanagan Valley),"The impenetrably obscure label design makes this difficult to find, but once your hands are on the bottle, it's smooth sailing. A “second label” Bordeaux-style blend, this delicious, fruity and distinctive wine puts a wrap of tangy citrus around black cherry, coffee and licorice components. Malbec is the principal grape, with smaller amounts of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cab Franc.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,25.0,Blind Trust,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Okanagan Valley,,British Columbia,Canada,Laughing Stock,,
52664,92,Lost Blues 2013 Good Fences Syrah-Grenache (Santa Maria Valley),"Emerging winemaker Giovanni Grandinetti is one to watch. In this bottling he blends co-fermented lots of 60% Syrah and 40% Grenache from Bien Nacido and Murmur vineyards to produce aromas reminiscent of venison in a rainbow peppercorn glaze, with touches of tar and crushed graphite.

52673,92,Ventisquero 2012 Enclave Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),"Earthy aromas include herbal notes, a hint of tomato sauce, asphalt and dusty berry fruits. This has a raw tannic exterior but is softer in the middle.

52677,92,Greywacke 2014 Pinot Gris (Marlborough),"Full bodied, rich and carrying a bit of residual sugar, this is a fine example of the variety's potential in Marlborough.

52678,92,Rockburn 2014 Pinot Noir (Central Otago),"This wine seems soft and silky on the surface, but boasts a sinewy structure that should enable it to age well through 2025.

52684,92,Gilles Flacher 2013 Les Rouelles  (Condrieu),"This is aged in barrel, but the power of the source's granitic soils is such that the oak is barely noticeable.

It's rich and ripe in raspberry, strawberry and cola flavors, with an apparent sweetness that belies the dry finish. The acidity is adequate, giving it a tart softness.

56004,92,Halcon 2014 Oppenlander Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mendocino),"A deep color, concentrated fruit aromas, and equally concentrated fruit flavors give a lot of depth to this medium-bodied and lushly textured wine. It smells like black cherries and light baking spices, tastes like rhubarb and raspberry but also has some clove and cedar notes that add complexity. It's an all-around palate-pleaser that seems to keep improving hours after opening.",Jim Gordon,@gordone_cellars,38.0,Oppenlander Vineyard,Pinot Noir,Mendocino,,California,US,Halcon,,
56005,92,Joseph Swan Vineyards 2014 Saralee's Vineyard Gewürztraminer (Russian River Valley),"This is a lovely, lilting and light version of the variety, so rarely found in this appellation.

Hot toast, lemon curd and cut red apple show on the lush, perfectly ripe but not at all buttered nose.

56009,92,Avennia 2013 Gravura Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot make up nearly equal parts of this blend, with the balance Cabernet Franc (9%). Coming from a who's who of vineyards that includes Bacchus, Red Willow, Klipsun and Boushey, it offers nuanced, supremely well balanced aromas of spice, dried herb, raspberry and blackberry.

Harlan,Central Coast,California,US,Calera,,
56012,92,Château de Berne 2015 Pur Rosé (Côtes de Provence),"With its striking (and heavy) square white bottle, this wine will certainly make a statement on any table. The wine itself, with Hubert de Bouärd (whose family owns Château Angélus) as consultant, is impressively ripe and concentrated, but still retains its crisp, fresh poise.

The aromatic intensity and persistency is stratospheric and the wine doles out generous notes of red cherry, charred volcanic tones and licorice.

56442,92,Corison 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"We all wonder if those cult Cabs will age, but there's no doubt that this is a cellar guarantee. Cathy Corison makes her Cabs less ripe than many others, so the alcohol is lower and the acids and tannins are harder and drier. That's in youth.

56845,92,Tangent 2009 Paragon Vineyard Viognier (Edna Valley),"Almost all of California's best Viogniers are oaked, but not this one. As with Tangent's previous bottlings, it just shows that this particular wine doesn't need wood to be opulent and completely satisfying.

Ripe, lush and complex, it offers flavors of plum and cassis, with an appealing texture and moderately gripping tannins.

A selection from Mr. Pinotage, this is somewhat closed and shy at present, but shows a core of tight black fruit, oodles of spice, a full structure and ample acidity to suggest this is designed for some time to age. Touches of char, tree bark and leather add earthy, gamy accents to the blackberry and boysenberry fruit tones.

62798,92,Sol Rouge 2010 Cabernet Franc (Red Hills Lake County),"A great find, this is fully ripe but not too full bodied, offering opulent dark plum and black currant aromas, broad and rich flavors, and a plush, velvety texture.

62802,92,Hiedler 2013 Gaisberg Reserve Riesling (Kamptal),"This wine is reminiscent of ripe, plump pears and yellow plums fallen onto wet, cool autumn leaves on moss and grass.

62803,92,Jalits 2012 Reserve Blaufränkisch (Eisenberg),"An intriguing nose of slight but very pleasant smokiness with mere edges of peat and earth leads onto a notion of black cherry.

62890,92,Archery Summit 2008 Looney Vineyard Pinot Noir (Ribbon Ridge),"The Looney Vineyard bottling is the outlier in the Archery Summit lineup—a different AVA and a non-estate vineyard. The Ribbon Ridge AVA is a subset of a subset within the Willamette Valley, and it may be the hidden gem for producing great Pinot Noir. This wine is sensual, spirited, spicy and smooth. The cherry and raspberry fruit is highlighted with bright acidity and whiffs of baking spices. The new oak is gently applied and the use of wild yeasts may have added some textural nuances also.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,85.0,Looney Vineyard,Pinot Noir,Ribbon Ridge,Willamette Valley,Oregon,US,Archery Summit,,

62895,92,Reverie 2008 Estate Petit Verdot (Diamond Mountain District),"Petite Verdot is a difficult wine to make interesting in its own right, but Reverie has pulled it off. It's very much like a Diamond Mountain Cabernet Sauvignon, dry, tannic and filled with blackberry, cherry and cassis flavors.

Thanisch (Erben Müller-Burggraef) 2009 Bernkasteler Lay Auslese Riesling (Mosel),"Despite this wine's intense richness and ample residual sugar, it is so well balanced that it does not come across as being particularly sweet.

62907,92,Dr. Heidemanns-Bergweiler 2009 Bernkasteler Badstube Spätlese Riesling (Mosel),"If there is any criticism to be made of this wine, it might be that it is just too fruity.

63821,92,Bonterra 2012 The Roost Blue Heron Vineyard Chardonnay (Mendocino County),"A buttery aroma leads to rich butterscotch flavors and a buttery finish, too. But then there's more with each sip. The wine is dry but easy on the palate, and reveals tasty apple, almond and toasted walnut flavors with time. These all add complexity and lift it well above the ordinary.

It smells fresh and sophisticated, with bright cranberry and rich black-cherry notes shaded by cinnamon and nutmeg. This should stand up to the richest rack of lamb and age well, too.

63834,92,Trust 2012 A Stone's Throw Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This wine—named for two adjacent vineyards—is 75% Dionysus Cabernet Sauvignon with the balance Bacchus Cabernet Franc.

64071,92,Seghesio 2008 Home Ranch Zinfandel (Alexander Valley),"An awesome Zinfandel that shows how delicious the variety can be in the right hands. The wine is unusually complex for Zin, showing not only its briary wild berry flavors but deeper, terroir-driven notes of minerals. The tannins are strong but very fine, while crisp acidity provides balance. Definitely hot in the finish, but fiery barbecue will be a perfect pairing.",,,36.0,Home Ranch,Zinfandel,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,California,US,Seghesio,,
64072,92,Silver Oak 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"Not clear if this is a long-term ager, but you definitely want to give it a good decanting of at least four hours. You should even pour the glasses and let them to stand for an hour. The interaction with oxygen will open the wine up and allow it to express its herbal, soft deliciousness.

64076,92,Louis Latour 2008  Charmes-Chambertin,"The wine is defined by its power and dense concentration. It shows solid black fruits, plums, fig and licorice as well as dark tannins.

64079,92,Martin Ray 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Mountain),"A very successful Cabernet that continues the winery's string of mountain bottlings. It's dry and classically balanced, with a firm minerality bracing flavors of blackberries, black currants, herbs, spices and smoky oak. The firm tannins are a bit numbing now, so give it 3 or 4 years in the cellar to settle down.",,,45.0,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,California,US,Martin Ray,,
64080,92,Ojai 2007 Bien Nacido Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Merges Ojai's leaner, more elegant style of winemaking with the rich pedigree of this fine vineyard to produce a dry, complex and food-friendly wine. It's zesty in acidity, with intricate flavors of cherries, cola, minerals and dried herbs. Should do interesting things over the next six years.

64083,92,Roar 2008 Pisoni Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"You don't look to Pinots from this vineyard for delicacy. You look for power, sheer butt-kicking audacity. And that's what you'll find in this '08 from Roar. It's almost Rhône-like in the dark color and full-bodied richness, with its chocolate and black cherry fruit. But that's Pisoni for you.

64150,92,Goodfellow 2013 Richard's Cuvée Chardonnay (Ribbon Ridge),"Sourced from the Whistling Ridge Vineyard, this was previously bottled under the winemaker's Matello label. It's packed with apple and pear fruit flavors, supported with ample acidity. Smooth and fleshy, its 50% new oak remains subtly integrated, with highlights of caramel and butter peeking out. It's well balanced, but you'll note that there are tartaric crystals (utterly harmless) clinging to the cork, suggesting that it was not cold stabilized.

64153,92,Angove 2014 Warboys Vineyard Grenache (McLaren Vale),"A step up from the solid 2013, this vintage offers more vivid raspberry fruit and cracked pepper.

64154,92,Archery Summit 2014 Arcus Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"This is a real cherry bomb, showing terrific concentration and purity of fruit. Those vibrant flavors come in a swath of cola, then dive into a compact finish that leaves a residual hint of chocolate seltzer.

64155,92,Archery Summit 2014 Renegade Ridge Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"At first this seems sculpted in a feminine style, meaning elegant, graceful and light on its feet. It's a complete and satisfying wine, with strawberry, raspberry and cola flavors intertwined.

64157,92,Calera 2014 Viognier (Mt. Harlan),"This is one of the harder grapes to tame in California, yet those wanting to walk the razor blade balance between ripeness and freshness should copy this Josh Jensen version. Candied nectarine, white peach, cherimoya and jasmine show on the ripe, honeyed nose, but then the palate restrains that exuberance with chamomile, sour pear peels and sea salt flavors.",Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann,34.0,,Viognier,Mt.

73246,92,Ponzi 2013 Reserve Chardonnay (Willamette Valley),"Although 2013 may have been a difficult vintage, for some winemakers it resulted in immaculate wines with impeccable precision and focus.

73619,92,Bodega Catena Zapata 2012 Nicasia Malbec (La Consulta),"This is overtly charred and blackened on the nose, as if it were exposed to maximum-toast oak during the aging process; additional aromas of charred beef and herbs add complexity.

Offers a juicy plum and cassis core, with oak, tobacco and earth accents, and a char and cocoa notes on the back end.

The bouquet is full of exotic oils, nuts and some horsehide. In the mouth, it's a touch salty and astringent, but there are buttery, sweet undertones and great focus.

87278,92,Domaine Serene 2012 Evenstad Reserve Chardonnay (Dundee Hills),"This reserve is actually one of the winery's less expensive Chardonnays.

Thoroughly delicious, and ready for immediate enjoyment.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,55.0,Evenstad Reserve,Chardonnay,Dundee Hills,Willamette Valley,Oregon,US,Domaine Serene,,
87279,92,Fritz Haag 2013 Trocken Riesling (Mosel),"Sumptuous notes of sugar cookie and honeydew perfume this lavish, full-bodied bottling. It's dry on the palate with piercing white-grapefruit acidity, but balanced by a rich, almost creamy, mouthfeel. The finish lingers luxuriously with a murmur of lime-zest astringency.",Anna Lee C. Iijima,,22.0,Trocken,Riesling,,,Mosel,Germany,Fritz Haag,,
87280,92,Reichsgraf von Kesselstatt 2012 Kaseler Nies'chen Trocken GG Riesling (Mosel),"While sprightly and lean in style, this dry, mineral-tinged Riesling seems to round out on the palate, building in ripe white-peach and grapefruit flavors. Penetrating lemon-lime acidity wins out on the finish, along with a pleasant bite of citrus zest.",Anna Lee C.

87281,92,Robert Weil 2012 Kiedrich Gräfenberg Eiswein Riesling (Rheingau),"Pollen and dust notes lend an earthy, mineral tone to ripe tangerine and peach flavors in this bristling, bright eiswein.

87292,92,Benjamin de Rothschild & Vega Sicilia SA 2009 Macán Clásico  (Rioja),"Lightly baked and charred on the nose, this is a well-oaked wine showing blackberry, cassis and lemon peel aromas. A saturated, layered palate features loamy blackberry and cassis flavors offset by peppery spice and cocoa dust. Licorice and blackened oak revive a sense of char on a broad, full finish. Drink through 2022.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach,50.0,Macán Clásico,Tempranillo Blend,Rioja,,Northern Spain,Spain,Benjamin de Rothschild & Vega Sicilia SA,,
87293,92,Fiddlehead 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara),"This bottling masterfully handles the young appellation's tropically inclined fruit, with apple candy aromas and a soft, rich mouthfeel. The flavors nod briefly toward the traditional greener, grassy side of the grape, but it's a smoother experience, less biting, with a hint of barrel smoke.",Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann,25.0,,Sauvignon Blanc,Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara,Central Coast,California,US,Fiddlehead,,

87323,92,Neyers 2013 Neyers Ranch Conn Valley Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Black color shows a depth of extraction in this earthy, burly wine.

87324,92,Quivira 2013 Petite Sirah (Dry Creek Valley),"Juicy cherry, strawberry and blueberry compete for attention in this fully plush and powerfully built wine.

87325,92,Rainoldi 2010 Sassella Riserva  (Valtellina Superiore),"Aromas of underbrush, baking spice, violet and Alpine herb come together on this elegant wine.

87327,92,Sangenís I Vaqué 2000 Clos Monlleó Gran Reserva Red (Priorat),"If you're curious about how Priorat wines age, this 16-year-old blend of Garnacha and Carignan is a good indicator. Mature aromas of earthy grit, leather and spicy plum rest in front of a flush jammy palate with structure. Peppery berry and plum flavors match the nose, while this folds in sweet syrupy notes of chocolate and berry jam prior to a long spicy complex finish. Drink through 2020.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach,90.0,Clos Monlleó Gran Reserva,Red Blend,Priorat,,Catalonia,Spain,Sangenís I Vaqué,,
87328,92,Viña Cobos 2013 Volturno Cabernet Sauvignon (Perdriel),"Gritty berry aromas are solid but a bit underwhelming for a wine of this price. Heavy, sticky and tannic on the palate, this tastes of herbal berry fruits and a ton of oak. That woodiness reverberates on the finish via maple, resin and toast flavors, while hard tannins make this more about power than finesse. Drink through 2025.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach,230.0,Volturno,Cabernet Sauvignon,Perdriel,,Mendoza Province,Argentina,Viña Cobos,,
87519,92,Château de la Grave 2010 Caractère  (Côtes de Bourg),"A rich, velvet textured wine, full of dense, dusty tannins and sweet black Merlot fruits.

87520,92,Château Vignelaure 2012 Rosé (Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence),"A complex, rich and ripe wine. It shows both a tannic edge and full red fruit flavors.

87521,92,Daou 2010 Soul of a Lion Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"Based on Cabernet Sauvignon, this Bordeaux-style blend will make you take a second look at Paso Robles. It's softly tannic and enormously complex, offering waves of black cherries, currants, licorice, mocha and sweet oak.

87522,92,Den Hoed 2009 Andreas Cabernet Sauvignon Wallula Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Horse Heaven Hills),"100% Cabernet Sauvignon from Wallula Vineyard, this brooding wine screams of the Horse Heaven Hills with notes of dusty earth, black currant, and bittersweet chocolate.

87523,92,Dolina 2011 Rio Vista Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"This wine is silky and well-balanced in acids and tannins, with judicious oak influences framing complex cherry, red currant and spice flavors. Feels very rich, yet the alcohol is a modest 13.7% by volume. Coming after the high-scoring 2010 vintage, Dolina's 2011 is fine to drink now, and should develop bottle notes over the next six years or so.",,,30.0,Rio Vista Vineyard,Pinot Noir,Sta.

87524,92,Prinz Salm 2010 Wallhausen Johannisberg GG Trocken Riesling (Nahe),"Everything about this dry, voluptuous Riesling is intense and penetrating.

87525,92,Jada Vineyard & Winery 2010 Jack of Hearts Petit Verdot Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"This is a huge wine, that's insanely rich and concentrated. It tastes like the ripest summer blackberries, still warm from the sun, mashed and drizzed with crème de cassis and chocolate syrup. The estate vineyard is on Paso Robles' west side, and quite high in elevation in the southern spur of the Santa Lucia Mountains. The wine is ungainly now, and needs time to develop. Better after 2017.",,,50.0,Jack of Hearts Petit Verdot,Cabernet Sauvignon,Paso Robles,Central Coast,California,US,Jada Vineyard & Winery,,

87527,92,Longoria 2010 Fe Ciega Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"The alcohol on this bottling is lower than most Fe Ciegas have been in the past, reflecting the cool vintage. The wine seems more austere than in the past, withholding a bit of the early appeal it used to show. Nonetheless, it's wonderfully structured in acids and tannins and very dry, with a judicious application of oak, and there are intricate flavors of cherries, red currants and herbs. Seems like it could shine with age, so give it six years in the cellar.",,,48.0,Fe Ciega Vineyard,Pinot Noir,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,California,US,Longoria,,

87529,92,Minassian-Young 2011 Grenache-Cinsault Rosé (Paso Robles),"California rosé is awfully hard to get right. It's usually too sweet, too heavy or both. With this Grenache-Cinsault blend, Minassian-Young knocks it out of the park. The wine is dry, delicate, modest in alcohol, and complex, with subtle peach, rosehip tea, orange zest, watermelon and spice flavors. A great bargain, but only 64 cases were produced.",,,16.0,Grenache-Cinsault,Rosé,Paso Robles,Central Coast,California,US,Minassian-Young,,
87530,92,The Eyrie Vineyards 2011 Original Vines Pinot Gris (Dundee Hills),"Unique in style and sourced—these are the oldest Pinot Gris vines in the country—this young, yeasty, textural wine will surely continue to improve in the bottle.

87533,92,Williams Selyem 2011 Heintz Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Shows the usual Williams Selyem Chardonnay profile of huge fruit and flashy oak. This opulent wine would be over-the-top except that it's balanced by crisp, lemony acidity, and somehow retains a tight core with a gravitational tug that keeps the richness focused.

87534,92,Numanthia 2010 Termes  (Toro),"This is a ripe, dark but balanced Toro with pastry, prune, blackberry and vanilla aromas.

87536,92,Balletto 2011 Estate Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"An exceptionally good Pinot, from a winery that frequently gets overlooked, perhaps because they're not charging an arm and a leg. The wine is light and silky in the mouth, with alcohol well under 14%, and marked with crisp acidity and fine-grained tannins. The flavors are classic pomegranates, rhubarbs and black cherries. Should develop over the next 4–6 years. What a great value.",,,29.0,Estate,Pinot Noir,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,California,US,Balletto,,

87538,92,Clos Solène 2011 Essence de Roussanne Roussanne (Paso Robles),"This is an elaborate wine that's dense, complex and immensely enjoyable. It has a fleshy, meaty quality, like a buttery veal piccata, alongside ripe white and yellow fruits. There's a firm, minerally quality, highlighted by crisp acidity, and the finish is bone dry.

The main aroma resembles oak and cedar dust, with ripe blueberries behind it. Flavors then turn very chocolaty and deep, while the texture is quite sleek for something this concentrated.

90172,92,Stephen Ross 2011 Bien Nacido Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),"It's hard to define minerality in a wine, but this Chardonnay has it. It tastes and feels like a lick of chalky stone.

90186,92,Senses 2011 Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast),"This hews to a leaner, minerally style remniscent of Chablis.

It's sweet-tart tangerine and stone-fruit flavors also pack a punch on the palate.

91194,92,Delectus 2010 Cuvée Julia Red (Knights Valley),"Easy to see what the winemaker was aiming for with this Cabernet Sauvignon-based wine. Sheer opulence was the goal, and it succeeds. The wine is soft and gentle, with ultrarefined tannins and incredibly ripe, concentrated blackberry jam, blueberry, chocolate and sweet oak flavors.

The nose is full of butterscotch and oxidized aromas of fine Sherry. The palate has a big feel, purity and fine acidity, while flavors of smoke, toast and oxidized white fruits finish waxy, creamy, oaky and long.

Underneath that sits and earthy, if slender, dry Riesling which has a subtle understated richness that seems very firmly anchored in earth.

Cofermented with 3% Viognier, it's a silky wine with flavors of blood, meat and earth dominating. Tannins are ripe, and it was barreled in second-fill oak, preserving the natural flavors of the vineyard.

It's big, fat and chewy for a Pinot Noir, but despite the size retains elegance due to the fine acid-tannin structure.

They have largely succeeded, although it's a very different style than you'll find from anything on the coast.

We think it very well might be; the wine is midnight madness, meaning it's dark as night and richly draped with blackberry, cassis, black plum and overall lushness.

98423,92,Au Bon Climat 2010 Knox Alexander Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"This low production Pinot Noir will be scooped up by sommeliers who understand how good it is with so many of their entrées. The alcohol is modest, and the oak is in the background despite being comprised of 75% new French barrels. That's because the raspberry, cola and tea flavors are so strong, they're able to stand for themselves. The grape source is from Jim Clendenen's personal Le Bon Climat Vineyard and Bien Nacido.

98424,92,Tudal 2009 Legacy Lot 30 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Some Napa Cabs that are ageable also are good to go now because the fruit is so ripe and the tannins are soft. Not this one. It's almost old-fashioned in tannins, with a lockdown astringency. But it's balanced and elegant, and the flavors are rich in blackberries, cherries, currants, cocoa and sweet oak.

Made from Viognier, Verdelho, Vermentino and Sauvignon Blanc, it's one of the most beautifully drinkable whites on the market today, at a great price.

98426,92,Clendenen 2008 Bien Nacido Estate Plantings Petite Verdot (Santa Maria Valley),"A superb red wine, and in fact one of the best Petit Verdots ever produced in California. It's so delicate, it has the weight of a fine Pinot Noir, which is mainly the result of low (by California standards) alcohol. There's an exquisite range of black cherry compote, mushu plum sauce, currant, baking spice and sandalwood flavors.

Mainly Chardonnay, with 21% Pinot Noir, this was aged on its lees for seven years, giving it a soft creaminess and also an intense, doughy yeastiness. The raspberry, lime, toast and vanilla flavors are rich and slightly honeyed.

Aromas of anise and licorice are exotic and a bit unusual, while blueberry, blackberry and herbal hints fill out the bouquet.

99297,92,Villa Matilde 2005 Tenuta di Altavilla  (Taurasi),"What sets this Taurasi apart is a distinct floral note of blue flower or pressed rose that sits over a much broader and bolder base of dark spice, black fruit, prune, resin and cola. The little floral accent adds a feminine touch to what is without a doubt one of Italy's most masculine wines.",,,,Tenuta di Altavilla,Aglianico,Taurasi,,Southern Italy,Italy,Villa Matilde,,
99298,92,Cinnabar 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Cruz Mountains),"Cinnabar produced this wine and has held it back longer than most other wineries. As a result, the 100% Cabernet has achieved a velvety softness, making it immediately drinkable. It has pretty flavors of cherries, black raspberries, chocolate and smoky oak.",,,45.0,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Santa Cruz Mountains,Central Coast,California,US,Cinnabar,,
99299,92,Guarachi Family 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A very rich, dramatic, indisputably Napa Cabernet. The fruit is ripe in blackberries and cassis, the tannin structure is vibrant and living, and the oak application is superb. A fashionable Cab that should develop over the next eight years.",,,65.0,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Napa Valley,Napa,California,US,Guarachi Family,,
99300,92,Guy Saget 2009 Le Domaine Saget  (Pouilly-Fumé),"Perfumed, rounded wine, packed with fruit, its ripe flavor given point with kiwi fruit acidity.

99301,92,Kapcsandy Family Winery 2008 Grand Vin Cabernet Sauvignon (Yountville),"Dense, dry and ripe, this is a Cabernet to lay down. It's really tough and gritty in tannins, but solid in wild blackberry, cherry and herb flavors. A powerful young Cabernet that needs 6–8 years to come around.",,,325.0,Grand Vin,Cabernet Sauvignon,Yountville,Napa,California,US,Kapcsandy Family Winery,,
99302,92,Lachini 2008 ‘S' Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"Sineann's Peter Rosback is the winemaker for this particular Lachini bottling, and has been through seven vintages. This is the best yet, perhaps a function of a maturing vineyard and a great year. Lush and textural, it dances among flavors of pretty cherry-berry fruit, lightly whipped chocolate and accents of sandalwood and spice. It gains strength through the finish, lingering gracefully.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,45.0,‘S',Pinot Noir,Chehalem Mountains,Willamette Valley,Oregon,US,Lachini,,
99303,92,Librandi 2007 Le Passule 500ml White (Val di Neto),"Le Passule is a gorgeous passito dessert wine that offers sweet tones of honey, candied apricot and almond paste backed by a zesty touch of exotic spice.

99304,92,Robert Mondavi 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"A big, dense, brooding wine, concentrated and powerful in blackberries, cherries and cassis. The tannins are sandpapery, giving the mouth a scoury feeling added to by the acids. An interesting, complex young wine that's well made and needs time to come around. Drink it over the next 6–8 years.",,,45.0,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Oakville,Napa,California,US,Robert Mondavi,,
99305,92,Dr. Heidemanns-Bergweiler 2009 Graacher Himmelreich Spätlese Riesling (Mosel),"The three Himmelreich '09 spätleses tasted were all terrific, with this example showing great intensity and power without excessive weight.

99308,92,Château Moulin de la Rose 2008  Saint-Julien,"One of the few properties in Saint-Julien that is not a cru classé, Moulin de la Rose does have all the elegant, structured character of the vintage.

99594,92,Donnafugata 2011 Mille e Una Notte  (Contessa Entellina),"Aromas of French oak, mature black-skinned fruit, espresso and a hint of blue flower lead the nose on this structured red.

99595,92,Force Majeure 2013 Estate Grown Force Majeure Vineyard Syrah (Red Mountain),"The aromas of ground granite, dark raspberries, plum and pencil lead have not yet fully unfurled but still offer immediate allure. Flavors are saturated and layered, with the tannins providing some heft. It's a serious wine that provides a whole lot of enjoyment and that should benefit from time in the cellar.",Sean P.

99596,92,Glatzer 2011 Bernreiser Blaufränkisch (Carnuntum),"Tar-tinged black cherry and blueberry lead to a concentrated palate packed with dark fruit balanced by ample frehsness. This very fresh wine balances the intensity of its crunchy, juicy fruit with more savory and earthy elements. At present, it is four years old and not yet at its peak but already drinking well. Drink now through 2020.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino,45.0,Bernreiser,Blaufränkisch,,,Carnuntum,Austria,Glatzer,,
99597,92,Meinklang 2013 Pinot Noir (Burgenland),"Floral hints on the nose give way on the palate to a deep, concentrated core of forest fruit: there is the tartness of wild cranberry, the alluring aroma of wild raspberry and darker overtones of bilberry, all framed by brooding aspects of oak. Fruit and oak are in some kind of chiaroscuro dialogue that intrigues. Best to wait a little longer since real pleasure and elegance awaits.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino,19.0,,Pinot Noir,,,Burgenland,Austria,Meinklang,,
99598,92,Monte Volpe 2012 Primitivo (Mendocino),"Made in a structured, traditional and dry style, this wine will be great at dinnertime.

99599,92,Montes 2013 Purple Angel Carmenère (Colchagua Valley),"Like the name suggests, this Carmenère is opaque purple in color, with earthy, complex aromas of graphite, char and herbal black currant. The palate is, not surprisingly, saturated and dense. Flavors of toasty, minty black fruits are charred, while the finish tastes roasted, heavily oaked and blackened. Drink through 2021.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach,85.0,Purple Angel,Carmenère,,,Colchagua Valley,Chile,Montes,,
99600,92,Muhr-Van der Niepoort 2013 Samt & Seide Blaufränkisch (Carnuntum),"There is nothing obvious about this wine: everything is subtle and elegant. The nose holds back and the taut palate only unfurls slowly to show a floral, fruity wine that reminds one of crimson peony petals as much as of dark, juicy cherries. Yet there is nothing facile about this. It is the silky-smooth texture, however, that delivers the killer blow. A most sensuous, intriguing wine of great elegance. Little wonder: its name means silk and velvet",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino,29.0,Samt & Seide,Blaufränkisch,,,Carnuntum,Austria,Muhr-Van der Niepoort,,
99601,92,Netzl 2014 Rubin Zweigelt (Carnuntum),"An intense flavor of cinnamon- and pepper-dusted red cherries pervades nose and palate, with additional notes of white pepper spice. There is an ever so slight tannic grip, like the touch of a kitten's paw.

Rita Hills,Central Coast,California,US,Potek,,
99603,92,Prieler 2013 Blaufränkisch (Leithaberg),"The slightest minty lift is perceptible on the nose, hovering above black cherry. The palate shows tightly packed, dense, ripe but fresh fruit, as crunchy and juicy as ripe but tart cherries. There is something masculine in the muscular but fine structure. Tautness suggests that this will benefit from mellowing bottle age. Drink from 2017 through 2025.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino,55.0,,Blaufränkisch,,,Leithaberg,Austria,Prieler,,
99604,92,Josef Jamek 2014 Ried Achleiten Smaragd Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),"Friendly, appetizing and alluring notes of green Conference pear are most inviting. This plays on fresh fruit but duly acknowledges the peppery element of Grüner in the background.

99607,92,Weszeli 2014 Schenkenbichl Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),"Baked apple and freshly cut apple peel make for an appealing introduction.

99609,92,Signorello 2012 Laguna Knoll Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Raspberry crumble immediately comes to mind in this vineyard-designate, a luxuriously built, big-bodied expression of a warm, easy vintage.

99610,92,Smith & Hook 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Coast),"Truly a wine that overdelivers, this packs molten fudge cake, vanilla-laced black-currant syrup and chocolate pudding with a fresh sprig of mint on the nose. The palate is soft and dynamic, with ripe black currants given complexity though licorice and butter-softened roasting herbs, all wrapped in tannins that keep the flavors steady throughout.",Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann,25.0,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Central Coast,Central Coast,California,US,Smith & Hook,,
99611,92,Te Awa 2013 Single Estate Gimblett Gravels Syrah (Hawke's Bay),"A terrific value, this is one of the more forward Syrahs from Hawke's Bay's glorious 2013 vintage.

99612,92,Te Mata 2013 Coleraine Red (Hawke's Bay),"Coleraine is one of New Zealand's most prized red wines, so it's a pleasure to see it's back in the United States after several years of spotty availability. As always, it's a blend of undisclosed proportions of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc.

99614,92,Greywacke 2013 Chardonnay (Marlborough),"This is a fairly big, weighty Chardonnay, but one whose alcohol levels are balanced by crisp acids.

99621,92,Arista 2013 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"A lighthearted, refined and distinctive wine made from vineyards including Ritchie and Banfield, this white gets less time in oak than the single-vineyard designates, but sings in waxy apple, lemon, nutmeg and brioche.

101597,92,Gramercy 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Though mostly Cabernet from an excellent Horse Heaven Hills vineyard, this also includes 15% Merlot from Pepper Bridge. It coats the tongue with velvety softness and drying tannins. It suggests elegance and breed immediately, Cabernet's classic cassis married to herbal grace notes and a strong mineral streak. A lovely food wine.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,42.0,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Washington,US,Gramercy,,
101598,92,àMaurice 2007 Malbec (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Scents of cinnamon, peppery herbs and Asian spices.

101600,92,Iron Horse 2008 Native Yeast Chardonnay (Green Valley),"This is a very rich Chardonnay. It has complex, lush flavors of pineapples, lemons, limes, oranges and the smoky vanilla notes from 100% new oak. High acidity fortunately provides crisp balance. Almost too much of a good thing, it calls for equally rich fare, such as lobster or Ahi tuna tartare.",,,46.0,Native Yeast,Chardonnay,Green Valley,Sonoma,California,US,Iron Horse,,
101601,92,J. Bookwalter 2007 Protagonist Red (Red Mountain),"Lushly aromatic and toasty, the substantial oak flavors are set against deep, brambly berry and cassis fruits.

101602,92,Laetitia 2007 La Colline Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley),"A vigorous, masculine Pinot Noir. Dark in color, tannic and acidic, it has the weight of Grenache, although with silkier tannins. The flavors are impressively ripe and deep, suggesting raspberries, cherries, currants and a baked pie crust quality from oak. A bit ponderous now.

101603,92,Maroon 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Yountville),"This Cab is drinking very dry, tannic and austere in its youth.

101605,92,Quilceda Creek 2007 Palengat Red (Horse Heaven Hills),"Quilceda's Palengat is now a proprietary blend, not a strict Cabernet as before. You can smell the violets amidst nicely layered aromatics, built upon layers of black fruits, cassis and dark, smoky elements. Smoke, earth, coffee, a hint of iron and rock continue into the midpalate, which loses a little density as it moves through the finish. That may be a reflection of the young-ish (7 to 10 year old) vines.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,85.0,Palengat,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Horse Heaven Hills,Columbia Valley,Washington,US,Quilceda Creek,,

101609,92,Brander 2009 Cuvée Nicholas Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley),"A blend of Sauvignon Blanc, with one-quarter Sémillon, this white blend was aged on the lees in oak barrels. It shows the balanced elegance this bottling by Brander usually displays. Entirely dry, with a crisp burst of acidity, its flavors are of citrus fruits, white flowers, vanilla, minerals and a touch of tart, New Zealand-style gooseberry.

101612,92,Freeman 2008 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"Another in a string of fine Pinots from this producer. Shows real cool coastal influence in the brisk acidity, delicate structure and deep flavors of cherries and cola, which seem to have a long hangtime complexity.

101616,92,Martin Ray 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),"A fine, fancy Cabernet. It shows Diamond Mountain's famously hard tannins, but they're so finely ground, the wine is actually drinkable now, with a brief decant.

Still tightly wound, it shows complexity and plenty of natural structure, begging for more time in the bottle to allow for the gunpowder, smoky oak and dark, lush black fruit to marry further.

104046,92,Woodinville Wine Cellars 2013 Double Vision Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"This wine is an equal split of these two varieties.

104362,92,Uwe Schiefer 2014 Schiefer Blaufränkisch (Eisenberg),"Delicious blueberry, plum and cinnamon notes are still shy on the nose. The palate also holds them tight with pervading, lively freshness and a very slight spritz. White pepper spice colors the edges, making for an exciting, concentrated but light-footed wine that has rusticity and elegance in equal measure. Lovely now but sure to develop.

104363,92,Viña Cobos 2014 Bramare Malbec (Luján de Cuyo),"Dense mossy aromas of blackberry are slightly murky. Forget about delicacy on the palate, this is full-bodied and clattering.

104367,92,Bergström 2014 Le Pré du Col Vineyard Pinot Noir (Ribbon Ridge),"In French, the vineyard name means “the meadow on the mountain,” a fitting name for the site. This is a spicy wine, with a touch of red-hot candy. The pretty cherry fruit is underscored with earth and mineral, and the astringent, tea-flavored tannins morph into a suggestion of cola at the tail end.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,68.0,Le Pré du Col Vineyard,Pinot Noir,Ribbon Ridge,Willamette Valley,Oregon,US,Bergström,,
104368,92,Bernard Magrez 2016 Excellence des Muraires Rosé (Côtes de Provence),"Almost white in color, this is a rich wine with intense red-currant and raspberry fruits.

104374,92,Paternoster 2004 Riserva Don Anselmo  (Aglianico del Vulture),"Don Anselmo is among Basilicata's most important wines because it does a phenomenal job of highlighting the potential of this volcanic territory and the Aglianico grape. This interpretation focuses on soft, velvety tones of black cherry, graphite and spice that peel off in layers. The wine has a dark, concentrated color followed by great intensity, power and rock-hard tannins that need a few more years of bottle aging.",,,73.0,Riserva Don Anselmo,Aglianico,Aglianico del Vulture,,Southern Italy,Italy,Paternoster,,
104375,92,Vistalba 2006 Corte A Malbec (Mendoza),"Top-notch Malbec blended with other varieties gives Corte A a chance at greatness. In its current juvenile state, the wine is fresh, expressive and exotic on the nose, with mineral, licorice and spice in addition to a lot of driving berry character.

104377,92,Novelty Hill 2005 Stillwater Creek Vineyard Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The estate Syrah immediately shows a toastier nose and richer fruit than the excellent Columbia Valley bottling. Along with cassis, black cherry and blackberry fruit are powerful layers of toasted nuts, butterscotch and coffee.

The bouquet opens immediately into a fascinating complexity. What wafts up from the glass is a heady mix of incense, smoke, jam, toast, iron and herb—you can spend a pleasant 10 or 15 minutes just counting all the threads.

104804,92,Brosseau 2006 Cuvee Kilene Brosseau Vineyard Syrah (Chalone),"Brosseau scored with this bottling last year, and the '06 is as good, showing the same classy elegance. It's drily tannic, but enormously rich in currants, with complexities of smoky leather, tobacco, olive tapenade and tamari-sauteed wild mushrooms.

104807,92,La Chablisienne 2006 Vaulorent Premier Cru  (Chablis),"A premier cru that could almost be grand cru in quality terms, this is a big, ripe wine, the powerful yellow and green plum flavors spiced with some wood aging. There's a great, full-bodied explosion of fruit in the mouth, but the mineral edge of the wine suggests aging potential, perhaps even more  ageable than the 2005 vintage.",Roger Voss,@vossroger,35.0,Vaulorent Premier Cru,Chardonnay,Chablis,,Burgundy,France,La Chablisienne,,
104808,92,Lionheart 2007 Saralee's Vineyard The Angel's Share Marsanne-Roussanne White (Russian River Valley),"A distinctive wine.

104809,92,Sheridan Vineyard 2004 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Yakima Valley),"This is 100% new oak (primarily Taransaud, 32 months), and it's a marvelous example of the grape, the vineyard and the strengths of Washington fruit. The Shafer Hillside Select is the inspiration for the extended barrel aging and the focus on round, sweet tannins. This is a tight wine, with a lovely purity of fruit that captures the cassis, the black cherry, the subtle herbal character of the Cabernet grape.

104810,92,Silverado 2005 SOLO Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),"Here's a complex, layered wine that impresses for sheer power. It floods the mouth with ripe flavors of black currants, blackberries, black cherries, dark chocolate, anise and cedar that finish deep and long.

It's almost exactly half and half Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, and smells like beautifully ripe blackberries, boysenberries and cassis.

104813,92,Soos Creek 2006 Champoux Vineyard Red Wine Red (Horse Heaven Hills),"This could be labeled Cabernet Sauvignon; the only other grape in the blend is a 14% Cab Franc component. Rich black cherry fruit provides the solid base, but after that the wine tightens down, so decanting would be essential if you plan to drink it soon.

104822,92,Harrington 2006 Brosseau Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chalone),"Extraordinarily rich and ripe, just explodes with cherry jam, crushed black raspberries and sweet toasted oak and vanilla flavors.

104824,92,Byron 2006 Bien Nacido Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Very rich, very complicated, a young, dense, grapey wine that clearly needs time to come around. Dry and balanced in acids and tannins, it shows brilliantly ripe blackberry, black cherry and cola flavors, with an earthy note the Brits used to call beetroot.

105016,92,MacMurray Ranch 2009 Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands),"Russian River-based MacMurray Ranch turns to the Central Coast's Santa Lucia Highlands for Pinot Noir, with admirable results.

It has all the hallmarks of a superior Cabernet, with rich, delicious blackberry, cherry, licorice, Dr. Pepper cola and oak flavors, framed into soft, intricate tannins.

The balance is great. It is a wine that shows class and aging potential.",Roger Voss,@vossroger,25.0,Vom Schloss Reserve,Grüner Veltliner,,,Niederösterreich,Austria,Graf Hardegg,,
115798,92,Marques de Griñon 2003 Emeritus Red (Dominio de Valdepusa),"Hiding behind Griñon's impressive 2004s is this ultrapremium blend of Cabernet, Petit Verdot and Syrah. Emeritus is sweet and ripe with pipe tobacco, cassis, spice cake and chocolate aromas. It's immense and inviting, with grabby, plump blackberry fruit along with cinnamon, mocha and cola notes. Creamy, rich and almost unctuous. Drink over the next five years. 200 cases made.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach,75.0,Emeritus,Red Blend,Dominio de Valdepusa,,Central Spain,Spain,Marques de Griñon,,
115799,92,Mas Martinet 2005 Martinet Bru Red (Priorat),"One can make the argument that in 2005, Martinet Bru, Mas Martinet's “second” wine, is every bit as good and quite a bit more approachable than Clos Martinet. This wine is entirely solid and free of holes. It shows deep, ripe cassis and berry flavors along with chocolaty richness and accents of sage and herbs. Drink now through 2012.

115800,92,R&A; Pfaffl 2007 Hundsleiten Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich),"The Hundsleiten vineyard is on the last slopes of the Weinviertel looking across the Danube Valley. With its great exposure, it produces a rich style of Grüner, with added structure and minerality. In 2007, the vintage exposed the terroir, giving a flinty edge to the still-rich character.",Roger Voss,@vossroger,32.0,Hundsleiten,Grüner Veltliner,,,Niederösterreich,Austria,R&A; Pfaffl,,
115801,92,Scott Paul 2006 Audrey Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"Structure may be the Holy Grail in Oregon, even trumping terroir. This wine has an abundance of both; the Dundee Hills fruit brings rich flavors of blackberry and black cherry, along with interesting notes of iron and earth. But the lovely structure—a perfect balance of fruit, acid, oak and alcohol—takes the wine into a more complex dimension. It moves gracefully through the palate, adding a note of spice or a new fruit as it goes, then lingering in a taunting, teasing finish.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,55.0,Audrey,Pinot Noir,Dundee Hills,Willamette Valley,Oregon,US,Scott Paul,,
115802,92,Seña 2005 Red (Aconcagua Valley),"Arguably the best Seña to date. This blend of Cabernet, Merlot, Carmenère, Cab Franc and Petit Verdot opens with a mix of perfume, spice and prickle along with raspberry. The palate is flush and flashy, with a complex blend of strawberry, raspberry, vanilla, cinnamon and tobacco flavors. Smooth as a glass table, and slightly creamy.

115803,92,Finca Sandoval 2005 Red (Manchuela),"Ripe, sweet-smelling and “muy moderno,” but by no means is this Syrah-led warrior only fruit, bulk and oak. Spanish wine writer Victor de la Serna's wine gets better all the time. This vintage is like berry cake in a glass, but it's not short on anything, including acidity and tannic structure. Expect a blast of fruit flavor, intensity in reserve, and some forward oak, vanilla and butter. Should settle into form over the next 18 months.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach,53.0,,Red Blend,Manchuela,,Central Spain,Spain,Finca Sandoval,,
115804,92,Alion 2004  Ribera del Duero,"Big and modern is the path that Alion (owned by Vega Sicilia) follows. This vintage is excellent, the best since 2001. It offers sweet, ripe black fruit with solid but balanced tannins. Chocolate and leather give the finish sweetness and style, while the overall take is that this is a forceful but sexy wine.

High-toned aromas of raspberry, cherry, cranberry, barrel spice and dark fruit lead to concentrated, well-balanced red- and black-fruit flavors. The finish sails into the distance.

116303,92,Lyrarakis 2014 Kotsifali (Crete),"A luscious nose of chocolate-covered cherries and black pepper start this delicious Kostifali from one of Crete's wine champions.

116304,92,Maggy Hawk 2014 Stormin' Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"This full-bodied and relatively pale-colored wine offers a pretty combination of light cherry, cinnamon and nutmeg flavors.

116305,92,Marchesi di Barolo 2013 Coste di Rose  (Barolo),"Rose, chopped mint, red berry and new leather aromas slowly take shape on this fragrant red.

116309,92,Domäne Wachau 2016 Ried Bruck Federspiel Riesling (Wachau),"A rich hint of Golden Delicious apples appears first, followed by lively notes of ripe but fresh citrus and juicy Mirabelle plums. The palate has the same juiciness of fresh stone fruit, framed by lemon freshness but also slightness and elegance. This is light bodied, dry and very fresh, with a lovely edge of grapefruit-peel zestiness.

116313,92,Gary Farrell 2014 Martaella Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"From the heart of the Laguna de Santa Rosa, this vineyard-designate delights in rhubarb and strawberry, hugely pleasing in fresh fruitiness.

116316,92,Gunter Triebaumer 2016 Cuvée Spätlese Chardonnay (Burgenland),"Stone, earth and pear show on the nose. The palate joins with a bittersweet notion that recalls dried pear skin and dried orange rind. The body remains light, but flavors are anchored deeply and earthily. Made in a very balanced late-harvest style, it has an off-dry finish that will be dreamy with salty cheese.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino,15.0,Cuvée Spätlese,Chardonnay,,,Burgenland,Austria,Gunter Triebaumer,,
116317,92,Jalits 2015 Blaufränkisch (Eisenberg),"The nose is still closed and shy, while the palate speaks of ripe but tart cherry and blueberry fruit, coralled into a fine, firm tannic structure.

116607,92,Tenuta di Trinoro 2012 Magnacosta Cabernet Franc (Toscana),"Concentrated and structured, this wine also manages to be sleek and glossy but by no means weightless.

116608,92,ZD 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Peppery and high-toned, this wine offers a restrained and classical taste of red currant and cassis around dried herb and a fine-grained structure of tannin.

116609,92,V Puro 2011 Outrora Classico Baga (Bairrada),"This is a big, bold wine, packed with the typical Baga tannins and also with layers of ripe, dark fruit.

116619,92,Domdechant Werner 2013 Hochheimer Kirchenstück Trocken GG Erste Lage Riesling (Rheingau),"Exotic spice, stone fruit and orange rind tones perfume this aromatic dry Riesling.

116623,92,Francis Tannahill 2012 Jacob-Hart Vineyard Pinot Gris (Dundee Hills),"Sadly, this is the last vintage for this single-vineyard Pinot Gris. Oaky, spicy, buttery and rich, its mouthfilling flavors conjure up thoughts of that fabulous baked pear brioche you had at that little bakery in Paris.

116624,92,Francis Tannahill 2012 The Hermit Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills),"This biodynamically farmed, single-vineyard wine has subtle extra dimensions. Delicate accents of truffle, earth, graphite, iron ore and coffee grounds add to a round, fulsome wine with black cherry fruit.

116774,92,Gramona 2001 III Lustros Gran Reserva Sparkling (Cava),"Here's a serious Cava with Champagne qualities. The nose is nutty and rich, with hints of vanilla and popcorn that aren't overdone. The palate is toasty but also candied, with citrus blending perfectly with butterscotch. Plump and ripe through the finish, this is high-end and stylish, as Spanish bubbly goes.

116779,92,Pujanza 2005 Norte  (Rioja),"Opaque in color, with reduced aromas of mushroom, rubber and so forth. But do not give up on this masculine bruiser; it will loosen up with air and offer plum, leather and chocolate flavors that are nothing short of excellent.

116780,92,Quinta Santa Eufemia NV 30 Anos White  (Port),"A supreme wine that tastes of intense maturity, touched with oxidation. It has gained in color as it ages, so now it is a deep green gold.

116781,92,Sterling 2005 Diamond Mountain Ranch Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Despite significant youthful tannins this Cab has such deep, ripe flavor that you can drink it now. The mouthfeel is astringent and hard, in the way of a young wine, but waves of cherries, blackberries and currants flatter the tastebuds, and it also softens as it warms up in the glass.

120946,92,MacPhail 2011 Rita's Crown Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"The fruit on this Pinot Noir is flashier than anything that MacPhail has produced in their Sonoma County Pinots. That likely is due to the long hangtime of the Santa Rita Hills. The grapes got enormously ripe and rich in raspberries and cherries, and the wine would be a simple fruit bomb were it not for the excellent structure and a certain tangy minerality that will help it age through 2020 to 2022.",,,49.0,Rita's Crown Vineyard,Pinot Noir,Sta.

120953,92,Château Léoville Las Cases 2011 Le Petit Lion  (Saint-Julien),"Dominated by ripe Merlot, this is a forward, black currant-flavored wine.

It's quite a good wine, soft and rich and immediately likeable for its array of black currant, licorice and mocha flavors. The 100% new French oak is just right in smoke and cedary vanilla.

121172,92,Ilsley 2004 Single Vineyard Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),"This is the kind of wine the late, great André Tchelistcheff described as an iron fist in a velvet glove. The glove is the lush, forward blackberry, currant and cocoa flavors, the smooth texture and the seductively sweet new oak. The fist is the sheer power.

121176,92,Elias Mora 2004 Gran  (Toro),"Winemaker Victoria Benavides has maxed out the ripeness but has avoided any raisin, prune or molasses characteristics, which we like. Her Gran sits heavier on the palate than the 2004 Crianza, with firm tannins. But it also lingers more solidly on the back of the palate.

The palate follows with balanced, gentle sweetness: a play-off between apple ripeness and apple tartness. The notion is crisp and the body generous.

It's quite good, a full-bodied, powerful Cab with a molten core of blackberries and black currants and, of course, a thick, dry layer of firm tannins.

125418,92,Y Rousseau 2008 Le Roi Soleil Cabernet Sauvignon (Mount Veeder),"An interesting wine you can call intellectual. Its appeal is as much conceptual as hedonistic. It's the opposite of today's soft, sweet fruit bombs, being bone dry and somewhat austere, showing a tightly knit tannic structure. With an explosive, but controlled, central core of blackberries, it's a cellar candidate.

Lifted violet and berry notes are intoxicating on this spicy, deftly balanced wine.

128849,92,Calera 2012 Mills Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mt. Harlan),"Earthy elements of beet juice, wild raspberry, anise and graphite mark the nose of this single-vineyard wine by Central Coast Pinot pioneer Josh Jensen.

129136,92,Brion 2003 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Here's a beautifully structured young Cabernet, blended with a little Merlot, that has turned soft and generous enough after five years to drink now.

129138,92,Lemelson 2006 Jerome Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This complex wine lists no fewer than eight different clones in the blend, harvested at an average of just 1.8 tons/acre. The winery suggests that it is their most ageworthy Pinot Noir, and the structure of this young wine would support that assertion. It's tight, hard, compact with black fruits, smoke and chewy tannins. It's a wine that needs time to stretch its considerable muscles. The roughly 50/50 mix of new and once-used barrels adds baking chocolate, licorice and charred toast to the finish; well-integrated and buttressed with crisp acids. But the lingering flavor is of raspberry jam; so good you want to spread it directly on your tongue.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,58.0,Jerome Reserve,Pinot Noir,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Oregon,US,Lemelson,,

129140,92,Signorello 2005 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Shows all the hallmarks of a wine that will improve with mid-term aging. The flavors leap out now, and are all about ripe, crushed blackberries, red and black currants, anise and sweet, smoky cedar. Yet there's a tannic interference that's a little hard and astringent.

129141,92,Staglin 2005 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford),"This is obviously a beautiful Cabernet Sauvignon. It shows the pedigree and class you expect from a winery of Staglin's level, enormously rich in black currant, mocha and cedar flavors, with ripe, soft and complex tannins.

This 2007 seems a bit less ripe than previous efforts, so the fruit does not have the same sweetness, but the winemaking is exceptional and the flavors are woven beautifully.

129144,92,Stephanie 2005 Red Wine Red (Napa Valley),"This is the winery's priciest red and also its best. It immediately appeals for the soft, lush texture and the way the sweet fruit marries with the oak to wow the palate. Shows lush cherries and cassis, with rich nuances of vanilla, smoky wood and anise. Decadent and delicious, and best now through 2011. Mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, but comprised of all 5 Bordeaux varieties.",,,65.0,Red Wine,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Napa Valley,Napa,California,US,Stephanie,,
129145,92,Cambria 2006 Tepusquet Vineyard Late Harvest Viognier (Santa Maria Valley),"With the massive honeyed sweetness, this dessert wine is easy to enjoy, but it has more going for it than just that.

129147,92,Bollig-Lehnert 2006 Piesporter Goldtröpfchen Beerenauslese Riesling (Mosel-Saar-Ruwer),"Not quite as extremely sweet as some of the giant BAs from 2006, this wine actually shows a modicum of minerality and spice to go along with hints of dried apricot and honey.
